/**
 * Runs the flows-agent evaluation suite and gates it on the committed baseline.
 *
 * Launch line, from the repository root:
 *
 * ```bash
 * node evals/agent/run.ts
 * ```
 *
 * Add `--update` to rewrite `evals/agent/baseline.json` from this run. Do that
 * only when a score moved for a reason you can name, because the baseline is
 * the record of what the agent used to do. Add `--json` to print the full
 * machine-readable regression report when a run drifts.
 *
 * The run is offline: the only replaced pieces are the model behind the seat
 * resolver and the route it seals against, so no API key, network access, or
 * global CLI install is involved and every score is reproducible.
 *
 * Exit codes follow the shared CI convention. `0` means every case matched the
 * baseline and cleared the gate. `1` means the run disagreed with the committed
 * baseline: a score dropped, a score moved under an unchanged step key, or an
 * observation went missing. `5` means the gate could not decide, which is an
 * unusable harness rather than a result — repair it instead of reading the red.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
