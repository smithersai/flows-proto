# The testbed container's network condition: the one place the rig decides it.
#
#   testbed-network.sh resolve                     -> the requested mode
#   testbed-network.sh observe <container>         -> the mode docker reports
#   testbed-network.sh assert  <container> <mode>  -> both, and they must agree
#
# `SWB_TESTBED_NETWORK` names the condition and `none` is the default. It is a
# benchmark condition rather than a detail, so it is validated here, read back
# off the live container here, and stamped into the run's timings by whoever
# called this.
#
# ## Why the default is `none`
#
# The seal the codex lanes claimed was a seal on the tools an agent reaches for,
# not a kernel-level one. `shell_environment_policy.set` poisons the proxy
# variables of the commands codex spawns on the host; a `docker exec <container>
# curl …` starts its process as the docker daemon's child, inside a container
# that had the network on, so it inherits none of that. Two of the 45 `r90s`
# runs used exactly that to fetch the merged upstream fix
# (`sphinx-doc__sphinx-8721` fetched `pull/8721.patch`, `sympy__sympy-19495`
# fetched `pull/19495.diff`) and the `r90sh` lane repeated it. Will's ruling on
# 2026-08-24: a proper sandbox, so it cannot cheat.
#
# A container with no interface but `lo` cannot fetch a patch whatever command
# runs inside it, whatever the agent knows about proxies, and whatever a later
# harness invents. That is the difference this file exists to make: the previous
# seal had to be believed and could only be counted off transcripts afterwards,
# and this one is a kernel fact readable off the container while it runs.
#
# ## `docker exec` still works, and it has to
#
# Both arms are told to run the project's tests with `docker exec <container> …`,
# so a condition that took the docker socket away would measure a harness with
# no way to check its work — which is what `SWB_CODEX_NETWORK=off` does, and why
# that value is not the sealed lane. `exec` attaches a new process to an
# existing container's namespaces through the daemon's unix socket and needs no
# network of its own on either side of it.
#
# Measured on docker 29.4.0, 2026-08-24, in a `--network none` container, and
# re-measured by `./network-dryrun.sh`:
#
#   docker exec <c> sh -c 'echo ok'               exit 0
#   docker exec <c> ip -o addr                    lo, and nothing else
#   docker exec <c> wget -T3 http://example.com/  exit 1, no DNS
#   docker exec <c> wget -T3 http://93.184.216.34/  exit 1, no route
#   docker inspect -f '{{.HostConfig.NetworkMode}}'  none
#
# Spends nothing. `resolve` needs no docker; `observe` and `assert` do.
