/**
 * Reads an arm's journals for what a persistent realm actually did.
 *
 *   node lib/repl-evidence.mjs <journals-dir> [--json] [--instance <id>]
 *
 * `run-45.sh --lane <name>` may arm `FLOWS_CELL_MODE=repl`, which gives a run
 * one QuickJS realm for its whole life instead of one async function per frame.
 * The A/B that decides whether that is adopted is settled on resolved, cost and
 * wall clock, all of which `compare-runs.mjs` already reads. This reads the
 * things only the realm can be asked about, off the runs' own journals:
 *
 * | metric | the question it settles |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `carriedFrames` / `carriedReferences` | did cells actually reuse bindings from earlier cells, or was every cell self-contained? |
 * | `prints` | how much a frame said to its successor, in bytes and lines |
 * | `filing` | did the realm arm ever file state or project context — the surface it is supposed to have removed |
 * | `repeats` | the note-taking failure: did a run re-issue a call it had already settled, which is a run that lost track of what it had read |
 * | `referenceErrors` | the other note-taking failure: did a cell name something the realm was not holding |
 * | `guardedCompletions` / `callFreeFinalFrame` | did a run finish behind a check in the frame that ran it, or in a later frame that watched nothing |
 * | `rePrintFrames` | the print channel's own note-taking failure: did a frame print a line the frame before it had already printed |
 *
 * Both arms are read by the same code, and the two that are defined for both
 * are the ones that decide the A/B: `carried*` and `repeats`. The other two are
 * one-sided by construction and say so rather than pretending otherwise.
 *
 * **`prints` is REPL-only.** `CellTurn` emits `control.agent.cell-printed`
 * only where a realm ran, because filing mode has no print channel to journal —
 * a filing cell has no `console`, and what it says to its successor is the
 * `context` it returned. So the filing arm's zero here is structural, and the
 * quantity to read against it is `projectedContext`.
 *
 * **`filedState` and `projectedContext` are the filing arm's own.** In REPL
 * mode the contract offers neither, so a non-zero count says the arm did not
 * take. In filing mode they are how the surface works, and their count is what
 * the REPL arm removed.
 *
 * `carried*` is defined identically for both and is the honest control: a
 * filing cell's names vanish at its return, so a filing run that scores a carry
 * has a model *writing* as though the name survived, which is a different fact
 * from a realm that made it survive. Reading both is how the realm's effect is
 * told from the model's habit.
 *
 * Four definitions carry the weight, and each is deliberately conservative —
 * every one of them can undercount the realm's benefit and none can invent it.
 *
 * **A top-level binding** is a `const`/`let`/`var`/`function`/`class`
 * declaration whose keyword starts at column 0 of a cell's source. Column 0 is
 * the whole rule: it is the top level of a script, and a declaration indented
 * inside a block or a callback is not a name the next cell inherits. Object and
 * array destructuring patterns are read, so `const { matches } = found` binds
 * `matches`. A name declared at column 0 inside a template literal or a comment
 * would be counted, and that is the known bound; it can only add names that a
 * later cell then has to mention by hand to be counted as carried.
 *
 * **A carried reference** is an identifier token in cell N that a *strictly
 * earlier* cell of the same run bound at its top level, and that cell N does not
 * itself declare. That last clause is what makes the metric about the realm and
 * not about a habit of reusing names: a cell that writes `const hits = ...`
 * again has rebound the name and reads its own value, so it is counted as a
 * rebinding rather than as a carry. Identifiers inside string literals,
 * template literals, regular expressions and comments are stripped before the
 * scan — a `bash` script mentioning `hits` is data — and every JavaScript
 * keyword, global and contract binding (`ctx`, `console`) is excluded.
 *
 * `carriedFrames` counts the frames that carried at least one such name and
 * `carriedDepth` is how many frames back the furthest carry reached, which is
 * the difference between a realm used as one-frame scratch and a realm used as
 * a run's memory.
 *
 * **Filing** is read off the durable transition, not off the source: a
 * `control.agent.transition-applied` whose `continue` carries a non-null
 * `state` or a non-empty `context`. In REPL mode the contract offers neither,
 * so a non-zero count here says the arm did not take, and a zero says the
 * surface really was removed rather than merely undocumented.
 *
 * **A repeat** is one (flow, input) signature settled in two or more *different*
 * frames of one run. The signature is the canonical rendering of the pair, the
 * same one `lib/journal-facts.mjs` uses, so two spellings of one input collapse
 * to one signature. Re-issuing inside a single frame is never a repeat: a cell
 * that runs the same check before and after its edit is the contract working.
 *
 * Across frames, a repeat is three different things depending on the flow, and
 * conflating them would report the contract being obeyed as a defect. The split
 * is by flow, and the flow lists are the only benchmark-agnostic fact involved —
 * what a flow does to the tree:
 *
 * - `repeats.information` — `read`, `grep`, `glob`, `ls`. These return bytes of
 *   a tree they do not change, so a second issue in a later frame returns what
 *   the first one did. **This is the note-taking failure**, and it is the only
 *   class that is one: a run re-reading what it was already handed has lost
 *   track of what it had read. Both surfaces are supposed to prevent it — filing
 *   through `state` and `recall`, REPL through the variable — so it is defined
 *   identically for both and is the arm-versus-arm number.
 * - `repeats.check` — `bash`, `test`. Rule 7 *requires* re-issuing the exact
 *   verification pair after an edit, so a repeat here is the contract being
 *   followed. Counted, never charged.
 * - `repeats.edit` — `edit`, `write`, `apply_patch`. Re-applying an identical
 *   hunk in a later frame is a run that either lost its own edit or forgot
 *   making it. Rarer than the other two and worth its own row.
 *
 * A flow outside all three lists is counted under `other`, so a catalog change
 * shows up as an unclassified row rather than silently landing in the number the
 * A/B turns on.

 * effect where it is called, so a cell can run its verification and finish on

 * the shape it produced was see-then-attest: one frame that ran the check, and
 * a second, call-free frame that declared the outcome. This is the reader that

 *
 * **Guarded** is structural, not textual. A completion counts as guarded when
 * it sits directly behind an `if` test (`if (ok) ctx.done(...)`), inside a block
 * that an `if` test or an `else` opens, or after a `&&` or `?` that short-circuits
 * on a value. Every one of those is read by walking back from the completion
 * through balanced parentheses and braces of `masked` source, so a `{` in a
 * heredoc and an `if` in a comment are not structure.
 *
 * Conservative in the one direction that matters: it can call a real guard
 * unguarded — a completion behind an early `return`, or one whose check is a
 * `throw` above it — and it cannot invent a guard out of a cell that has none,
 * because every path to `true` requires an `if`, an `else`, a `&&` or a `?`
 * lexically dominating the call in code the realm actually ran.
 *
 * **REPL-only by construction.** A filing cell has no `ctx.done`: it finishes by
 * returning `{ _tag: "done" }`, so this reads zero over the filing arm and the
