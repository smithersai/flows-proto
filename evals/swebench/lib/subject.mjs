/**
 * Fingerprints the subject under test: the exact bytes `flows.sh` will load.
 *
 *   node lib/subject.mjs [--json] [--check] [--expect <file>] [--write <file>]
 *
 * A wave grades a harness. Which harness is a fact about module resolution,
 * not about which commits happen to be in the log, and until this file existed
 * nothing in the rig established it. Two things make it non-obvious:
 *
 *   1. The workspace `exports` map of every `@smthrs/*` package points at
 *      `./src/*.ts`, not at `./dist`. `packages/cli/dist/esm/bin.js` therefore
 *      resolves `@smthrs/harness/CellTurn` to
 *      `packages/harness/src/CellTurn.ts` and Node strips its types on load.
 *      The harness under test is the WORKING TREE, at the instant each CLI
 *      process starts. `packages/harness/dist` is not in the loaded graph at
 *      all, so its mtime proves nothing either way.
 *   2. `packages/cli` is the one package whose compiled output IS loaded, via
 *      the `bin.js` entry point. That dist can be older than its own source.
 *
 * So the fingerprint is: for every package in the CLI's `@smthrs/*` dependency
 * closure, where its entry point resolves to (src or dist), and a content hash
 * of the directory that answer selects — plus content hashes of the CLI's dist
 * and of the source that dist was built from. `--check` refuses a subject that
 * cannot be reported honestly.
 *
 * The CLI's source is in the stamp even though the process never loads it,
 * because point 2 above is the one place the loaded bytes and the source can
 * disagree. Every other package moves the stamp the moment a sibling lane edits
 * it, which is what stops a wave mid-flight; `packages/cli/src` used to move
 * nothing, so the one package whose build can go stale was the one package the
 * pin could not notice going stale. With both hashes in the stamp, a pinned pair
 * asserts that one `preflight.sh` run produced them together, and a CLI source
 * change stops the wave until another one does.
 *
 * What this still cannot see: a `dist/esm` that is complete, hashes cleanly, and
 * was compiled from source that is no longer on disk. Detecting that needs a
 * rebuild, which is what `preflight.sh` performs — it deletes `dist` before it
 * builds — so the pinned pair is only ever produced from a full rebuild.
 *
 * The refusals, and what each one caught:
 *
 *   no-cli-build      `packages/cli/dist/esm/bin.js` is missing.
 *   partial-cli-build a `src/X.ts` has no `dist/esm/X.js`. `--no-bail` and a
 *                     `...` filter closure both produce this silently.
 *   foreign-subject   a package resolves outside this checkout's `packages/`.
 *   unbuilt-dist      a dependency resolves into `dist/`, which this rig does
 *                     not build; its bytes would be whatever was left there.
 *   dirty-subject     a subject package's `src` differs from `git HEAD`, so no
 *                     report may name a commit as the thing it measured. Set
 *                     SWB_ALLOW_DIRTY_SUBJECT=1 to run anyway; the fingerprint
 *                     records the differing paths either way.
 *
