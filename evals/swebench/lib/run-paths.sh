#!/bin/bash
# Derives every per-run artifact path for one instance run, on either harness.
#
#   run-paths.sh <flows|codex> <instance_id> [run-index]
#
# Prints `KEY=value` lines for `eval`, so the two run scripts and the matrix
# driver cannot disagree about where a run's artifacts live. It is the one place
# that knows the naming rule:
#
#   no run index  ->  work/<id>          patches/<id>.patch          (today's names)
#   run index rN  ->  work/<id>-rN       patches/<id>-rN.patch
#
# Both spellings are produced by the same run script, so a single instance run
# by hand keeps the names every existing script already reads — `regen-patch.sh`
# and the scorecard's default `--work work` among them — while a matrix run
# carries its index in every artifact it writes.
#
# **The journal archive carries the same suffix as the patch**, so the two
# artifacts a selection is made from always come from one run. Keying the
# archive by `<id>-<index>` while the patch of an unindexed run is `<id>.patch`
# would let a hand run overwrite `journals/<id>-r1/` with a journal belonging to
# a different patch than `patches/<id>-r1.patch`, and the selector would rank
# the pair without anything saying they had come apart.
#
# `RUN_INDEX` is `r1` when no index was given, because a run always has one even
# when its paths do not carry it: the matrix manifest and every log line are
# keyed by `<id>-<index>`, and a nameless run could not be recorded in either.
#
# The instance id and the index are validated here rather than by the caller.
# Both reach a shell path, a docker container name and a docker image name, and
# this script's output is `eval`ed, so a value that is not `<repo>__<issue>` or
# `r<digits>` stops before any of that.
