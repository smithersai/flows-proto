/**
 * Everything an analyst needs about one instance, in one file.
 *
 *   node lib/trace-bundle.mjs <instance_id> [options]
 *   node lib/trace-bundle.mjs --prompt-only
 *
 * Writes `fullbench/analysis/<id>/bundle.md` — the task as the agent saw it, our
 * run's metrics and its frame-by-frame trace, codex's trace and its metrics —
 * and `fullbench/analysis/PROMPT.md`, the brief both analysts answer. One file
 * per instance, one brief for all of them, so two analyses of two instances are
 * answers to the same question and can be compared.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not in a bundle
 *
 * The bundle is the evidence for designing a *better trace*, and a better trace
 * has to be one a live agent could have produced. So it carries only what a live
 * agent had:
 *
 * | withheld | why |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | the gold patch (`patch`) | the answer |
 * | the graded test file (`test_patch`) | the answer, spelled as a test |
 * | `FAIL_TO_PASS`, `PASS_TO_PASS` | which tests are graded — knowing them makes every search trivial and every conclusion untransferable |
 * | `hints_text` | maintainer commentary from the PR, which no agent had |
 * | the evaluator's own report | it lists the graded identifiers by name |
 *
 * Enforcement is at the source rather than by scanning the output: the dataset
 * row is projected through `visible()` before anything is rendered, and that
 * projection is asserted to carry none of those keys. Verdicts are read from the
 * two ledgers, never from `fullbench/reports/<id>.json`, because that file names
 * every graded test.
 *
 * Scanning the finished bundle for those identifiers would be the wrong check
 * and would fail on honest traces: an agent that found the right test by reading
 * the repository put it in its own transcript, and that is the trace doing its
 * job. What matters is that this module never *adds* it.
 *
 * ## Options
 *
 * | option | default | what it changes |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `--clip` | 200 | characters kept of each call input, call result, codex command and codex output |
 * | `--text-clip` | 400 | characters kept of each codex assistant turn |
 * | `--cell-clip` | 3000 | characters kept of each of our cells |
 * | `--fb` | `fullbench` | the benchmark directory to read and write under |
 * | `--dataset` | `swb-verified.json` | the dataset the problem statement comes from |
 *
 * Every clip records what it dropped, so the analyst can see that a 40 KB test
 * log was 40 KB rather than believing the 200 characters were all of it.
 *
 * Spends nothing, needs no docker, needs no model. Safe to run while a benchmark
 * is in flight: it opens every journal read-only and writes only under
 * `fullbench/analysis/`.

export const PROMPT = `# The optimal-trace brief

You are given, for one SWE-bench Verified instance:

- **the task as the agent saw it** — the problem statement, the repository and
  the commit, and the environment the run had;
- **our harness's full trace**, frame by frame, with the cost of each frame in
  tokens, milliseconds and calls;
- **codex's trace** on the same instance under the same conditions, with its
  cost.

## What to construct

**Construct THE OPTIMAL TRACE for this instance.**

It must be *possible*: a way of solving this problem using **only the information
provided to a live agent**. No hindsight-only knowledge. Every lookup in your
trace must be motivated by something already visible at the point you make it —
the problem statement, or the result of an earlier step in your own trace. If a
step only makes sense because you know the answer, it is not in the optimal
trace.

It must be *minimal*: in wall-clock time, in model turns, and in dollars.

Write it as concrete flows cells — the \`ctx.call\` protocol, with as many calls
per cell as you like. A cell is one model turn; calls inside it are free of model
latency and are the lever that matters.

## What to diagnose

1. **Where our trace spent what the optimal trace does not.** Name each place —
   a frame, a call, a retry — and say what it cost in turns, seconds and dollars.
   Classify each one:

   | class | means |
   | --- | --- |
   | tool gap | no tool existed to do it in one call |
   | teaching gap | the agent did not know something the harness could have told it |
   | context-visibility gap | the agent could not see something it had already paid for |
   | model choice gap | a different seat would have done it cheaper or better |
   | pure waste | nothing would have been lost by not doing it |

2. **What codex did that the optimal trace adopts or rejects.** Name each one and
   say which, with the reason.

## What to state

Money and time are the point. State the optimal trace's estimated **frames,
tokens and dollars** in one table next to ours and next to codex's.

## What to end with

**At most three harness changes** that would move real runs toward your optimal
trace.

- General only. Never instance-specific, and never anything that would only help
  on this problem.
- Never an added review, audit or verification step. Runs are not made better by
  bolting more steps onto them; they are made better by giving the agent tools
  powerful enough to build up its own context in fewer turns.
- Each one: what it is, which class of waste above it removes, and what it would
  have saved on this instance.
