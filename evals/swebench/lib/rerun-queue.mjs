 * A re-run only measures a harness change if it meets **the same instances** as
 * the run it is compared against. So the population is derived, never declared:
 * it is exactly the set of ids the baseline ledger graded, and there is no flag
 * to add one or drop one. A re-run that cannot read the baseline has no
 * population and refuses to start.
 *
 * The order is the baseline's own — `lib/fullbench-queue.mjs`'s seeded draw —
 * filtered to that set. Two runs that meet the same instances in the same order
 * are comparable at every prefix, which is what makes a half-finished re-run
 * readable rather than merely incomplete.
 *
 * "What is left" is the same `isDone` rule the full benchmark resumes on: an
 * instance whose last row in the *re-run's* ledger is `graded` or `cleaned` is
 * finished, everything else runs from the top.
 *
 * Spends nothing, needs no docker.
