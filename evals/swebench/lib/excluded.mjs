/**
 * Instances excluded from the scoreboard by name, and the cause on record.
 *
 * An exclusion is a claim about the *measurement*, never about a harness, and
 * this file is the only place the rig makes one. Three rules keep it honest,
 * and every reader below obeys all three:
 *
 * 1. **Both arms, or neither.** An exclusion removes an instance from the
 *    denominator for flows and for codex identically. A row dropped from one
 *    side is tuning; a row dropped from both is scoping.
 * 2. **The cause is documented and is about the environment.** Each entry
 *    carries the sentence a reader would otherwise have to reconstruct from a
 *    disclosure section, and that sentence has to name something outside the
 *    agent — a grading container, a public service, a dataset defect. "The
 *    harness does badly here" is never a cause.
 * 3. **Both denominators are printed, always.** Every rate this rig states over
 *    a population an entry here can reach — `compare-runs.mjs`,
 *    `three-way.mjs`, `compare-arms.mjs` and `fullbench-report.mjs` — carries
 *    the scored count *and* the raw count, in the same sentence. A scoreboard
 *    that quietly says 43 is a scoreboard nobody can check. A population that
 *    excludes nothing reads exactly as it did before this file existed, so
 *    every reader can obey the rule unconditionally.
 *
 * ## The `psf/requests` pair
 *
 * `fullbench/reports/rerun-r92.md` records three waves producing three
 * different verdicts for one byte-identical patch, decided entirely by whether
 * `httpbin.org` was answering:
 *
 * - `psf__requests-1766` graded `resolved` in r90 and r91 and `unresolved` in
 *   r92, on a patch byte-identical across all three. It failed exactly one
 *   `PASS_TO_PASS` test — `test_mixed_case_scheme_acceptable` — and passed
 *   every one of its six `FAIL_TO_PASS` tests. That test needs an https route
 *   the grading container does not have: `lib/httpbin.sh` serves a documented
 *   local fallback, and the file says in those words that the fallback cannot
 *   answer it.
 * - `psf__requests-2317` went the same way. A re-grade against the public
 *   service found that service degraded too — 22 of 133 `PASS_TO_PASS` and 5 of
 *   8 `FAIL_TO_PASS` refused — so there was no healthy environment to appeal to
 *   in either direction.
 *
 * Both codex verdicts for the pair come from a backfill graded when
 * `httpbin.org` was healthy, so the two arms are not like-for-like on those
 * rows today. That is the whole reason the exclusion is by name: nothing about
 * either patch is in question, and no reading of these two rows says anything
 * about a harness.
 *
 * ## Getting an instance back
 *
 * Delete its entry. The right repair is an https listener the graded container
 * trusts, at which point both rows are measurements again and both arms can be
 * re-graded against it. Until then the honest number is the one that says how
 * many instances were scored and how many were run.
