You are working in a checkout of ${instance.repo} at commit ${instance.base_commit}.
The working directory is the repository root.

Resolve the issue below by editing the repository's source files.

## Your environment

Your \`bash\` flow runs on a macOS host with BSD userland. The repository's own
Linux environment and Python interpreter are in a container that has this exact
directory mounted at /testbed, so a file you change here changes there
immediately, and vice versa.

- Run anything that touches the project — imports, scripts, tests — inside the
  container, by naming it rather than by typing a docker line:

      { mode: "unhermetic", container: "${container}", cwd: "/testbed", command: "<command>" }

  For a program rather than a line, pass the program itself and let \`bash\`
  deliver it: \`{ ..., interpreter: "python3", script: "<program text>", args: [] }\`
  reaches the interpreter on standard input as data, so nothing quotes it,
  escapes it, or terminates it with a heredoc marker.
  GNU grep, GNU sed, and the project's dependencies are all available there.
  \`sed -i\` on the host is BSD sed and will not behave like GNU sed; run it
  in the container, or avoid it.${interpreterBullet}
- This repository runs its tests with \`${testCommand}\`, which takes the test
  paths to run as trailing arguments. It is the runner this project actually
  uses: other runners are not necessarily installed here.
- Git in this checkout behaves normally: \`git status\` and \`git diff\` show your
  own uncommitted edits and nothing else. This harness snapshots the working
  copy around every action, but it does so in a repository of its own, so
  nothing it writes ever appears in this checkout's history, index, or refs.
- To change a file, use the \`edit\` flow with an anchor a call just handed you:
  a \`read\`'s \`content\` is raw file text and a \`grep\` hit's \`text\` is the line
  itself, so either is an anchor exactly as it stands. \`edit\` matches those
  bytes or fails with the file's own text at the nearest region, and it answers
  with the hunk it applied. You may also anchor by a prior hit's \`startLine\`
  and \`endLine\`. Do not rewrite a whole file to change part of one: \`write\`
  replaces every byte, and a \`read\` that came back \`truncated\` is a fragment.
- \`read\`, \`grep\`, \`edit\` and \`write\` act on this directory directly and need
  no container.

## How to work

Reproduce the problem first, find the responsible code, make the smallest correct
fix in the library source, and verify it by running the relevant existing tests in
the container. Do not modify tests to make them pass, and do not add new test
files. Do not commit; leave your changes in the working tree.

Always check the exit code and output of a command before believing it worked. A
command that exits non-zero did not do what you asked.

Complete only when you have applied the fix to the source files and confirmed it
by running code. When you complete, set \`output\` to a short description of the
change you made.
