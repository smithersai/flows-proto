# One lock, owned by a named process, safe to leave behind.
#
#   lib/lock.sh acquire <dir> --owner <pid> [--label text] [--timeout s] [--stale s]
#   lib/lock.sh release <dir> --owner <pid>
#   lib/lock.sh reconcile <dir> [--stale s]
#   lib/lock.sh owner <dir>
#
# The rig serializes two things across concurrent lanes: the multi-gigabyte
# `docker cp` that extracts a testbed (`.extract-lock`), and the official
# evaluator (`.grade-lock`, because concurrent evaluator processes race in the
# post-run image cleanup and lose the report). Both used to be a bare
# `until mkdir <dir>; do sleep 5; done`, which has two defects that a benchmark
# running unattended for days will find:
#
# - **A `kill -9` while the lock is held wedges the rig for ever.** The holder's
#   `trap` never runs, the directory stays, and every later extraction spins on
#   `mkdir` with no timeout. Nothing in the rig ever cleared it.
# - **Release was not ownership-checked.** `run-instance.sh` installed a cleanup
#   trap that `rmdir`ed the shared lock *before* it had taken it, so any run
#   exiting for any reason released whatever run was extracting at that moment,
#   and two multi-gigabyte copies ran at once — the thing the lock exists to
#   stop.
#
# So a lock here is a directory holding the owner's pid, and:
#
# - a waiter that finds a lock whose owner pid is **dead** steals it at once, so
#   a crash costs the next waiter one poll rather than the whole run;
# - a waiter that finds a lock with **no pid file** — one an older copy of
#   `run-instance.sh` took before this helper existed — steals it only once it
#   is older than `--stale`, because liveness cannot be read off it;
# - `release` removes the lock **only when the caller owns it**, so a stray
#   release is a no-op;
# - `acquire` re-reads the pid file after writing it, so of two processes that
#   steal the same dead lock in the same instant exactly one keeps it;
# - and the pid file also immunizes the lock against the old `rmdir` trap still
#   running in another lane: `rmdir` refuses a non-empty directory.
#
# `--timeout` bounds the wait (an hour by default) and exits 1, because a
# caller that fails is recoverable and a caller that blocks for ever is not.
#
# Spends nothing, needs no docker.
