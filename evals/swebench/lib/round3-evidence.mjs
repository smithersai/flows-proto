/**
 * Reads a wave's journals for the changes `rerun-r92.md` asked for by name.
 *
 *   node lib/round3-evidence.mjs <journals-dir> [--json] [--instance <id>]
 *
 * `fullbench/reports/rerun-r92.md` ends in a ranked list of five next-steps.
 * Four of them shipped as harness changes, and each one is a claim about what a
 * run then *does*, so each is counted here off the run's own journal rather
 * than read off the diff that shipped it. This is the third such reader:
 * `lib/program-evidence.mjs` counts the eleven changes of the original program,
 * `lib/surgery-evidence.mjs` counts the four that answered r91, and this counts
 * the ones that answer r92. They are kept apart so no one of them has to be
 * re-baselined when another's question is settled.
 *
 * | metric | the next-step it settles |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `vacuous` | 1 — diagnose `django__django-14351` |
 * | `ladders` / `wallBound` / `survived` | 2 — the transport ladder's last rung |
 * | `transportRetries` | 2 — how often the class fired at all |
 *
 * Three definitions carry the weight.
 *
 * **A vacuous-verification observation** is a
 * `control.agent.vacuous-verification-observed` event: the controller telling a
 * run that the check it stored as `state.verification` is one this run had
 * already watched pass over the tree it was handed. The count is zero by
 * construction on any wave before the control existed, which is what makes a
 * non-zero count evidence rather than coincidence. The observation is a fact
 * and not a brake — nothing is refused and no cap is spent — so the interesting
 * number is never the firing but **what the run did next**, which is why every
 * firing carries its own after-record: how many frames the run still had, what
 * it stored as its proof after being told, whether it went and watched that
 * same check fail, and how the run ended.
 *
 * **A ladder** is a maximal contiguous run of `control.agent.model-retried`
 * events. Every rung of one sealed model step is journaled when that step
 * settles, so the rungs of a ladder share an `emitted_at_ms` and a ladder's own
 * wall clock cannot be read from the gaps between them. It is read instead as
 * the span from the frame's `turn-opened` to the rungs' own timestamp. For a
 * ladder that never recovered that span is the whole of what the frame spent
 * getting nowhere — the attempts and the sleeps together, which is exactly the
 * quantity `defaultModelRetryWindowMillis` bounds. For one that recovered it
 * also covers the attempt that worked, so it is an upper bound there and the
 * report says so.
 *
 * **A ladder survived** when a `control.agent.model-settled` follows its last
 * rung inside the same frame. That is the observable the rebuild produces: no
 * event records a client swap, because the swap is a process-internal exchange
 * of one HTTP client for another, but a ladder that ends in a settled model
 * call is a frame that got its answer across a transport that had been failing.
 * Under r92's harness that never happened: both ladders exhausted five rungs
 * and the run ended.
 *
 * A journal is opened read-only and never written, so this is safe against a
 * wave still in flight; a database mid-write is reported unreadable rather than
 * guessed at.
