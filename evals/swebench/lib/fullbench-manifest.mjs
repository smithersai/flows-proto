/**
 * Reads the full-benchmark manifest into the state it describes.
 *
 * `fullbench/manifest.jsonl` is append-only: every state an instance reaches is
 * a new row rather than an edit, because an edit is not crash-safe and this
 * ledger exists to survive a crash. **The last row for an instance is that
 * instance's state**, and this module is the one place that rule is written.
 *
 * Row kinds:
 *
 * | kind       | what it records                                                     |
 * | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | `header`   | one driver session: the pinned subject, the dataset, the settings    |
 * | `instance` | one instance reaching one state                                      |
 * | `note`     | something the driver wants a reader to see (HEAD drift, a pause)     |
 *
 * The states an instance passes through, in order:
 *
 * | state     | reached when                                                        |
 * | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | `pulled`  | the official image is local (pulled, or already cached)              |
 * | `ran`     | the harness finished and the patch is captured                       |
 * | `graded`  | the official evaluator returned a verdict for this instance          |
 * | `cleaned` | the testbed is gone and the image is deleted (or deliberately kept)  |
 * | `failed`  | the pipeline could not reach a verdict; the instance re-runs clean   |
 *
 * `graded` is the resume boundary: a resumed driver skips every instance whose
 * last row is `graded` or `cleaned`, and re-runs everything else from the top.
