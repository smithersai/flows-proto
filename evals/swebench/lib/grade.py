"""Runs the official SWE-bench evaluator against the architecture the rig uses.

    .venv-swb/bin/python lib/grade.py <the evaluator's own arguments>

The evaluator chooses its image architecture from `platform.machine()` alone
(`swebench/harness/test_spec/test_spec.py`: arm64 on an Apple Silicon host
unless the instance is in its `USE_X86` set). Every other part of this rig pins
`linux/amd64`: `run-instance.sh` and `run-instance-codex.sh` pull, extract, and
run `--platform linux/amd64`, so the agent edits an x86_64 checkout and its
patch is written against that tree. Left alone, grading on this host therefore
looks for `sweb.eval.arm64.<instance>`, finds none of the cached x86_64 images,
and tries to build one — which on 2026-08-19 timed out against the docker
socket and reported `django__django-16612` as an error rather than a verdict.

So this is not a thumb on the scale: it makes the grader use the same
architecture the patch was produced on. Nothing else is changed — the
evaluator's own code, dataset, and grading logic run untouched, and the tests
still execute inside the official image.

The override is process-local and lasts only for this invocation.

## SWB_EVAL_EXPORTS — environment the graded tests were always meant to have

    SWB_EVAL_EXPORTS='{"HTTPBIN_URL":"http://192.168.215.7/"}'
    SWB_EVAL_EXPORTS_REPOS='psf/requests'

`SWB_EVAL_EXPORTS` is a JSON object of shell variables to export inside the
instance container, prepended to the official `eval.sh` immediately after its
`set -uxo pipefail` line and before any of the evaluator's own commands.
`SWB_EVAL_EXPORTS_REPOS` narrows that to a comma-separated list of dataset
repos; unset means every instance in this invocation.

There is exactly one caller, and one reason. `psf/requests`' graded tests are
network tests: `test_requests.py` reads `HTTPBIN = os.environ.get('HTTPBIN_URL',
'http://httpbin.org/')` and roughly a third of the dataset's `FAIL_TO_PASS` and
`PASS_TO_PASS` identifiers for `psf__requests-1766` and `psf__requests-2317`
route through it. On 2026-08-21 the public httpbin.org answered 503, so those
tests failed for both harnesses regardless of patch — including 34 and 22
`PASS_TO_PASS` tests, which pass on the unmodified checkout by construction and
so indict the environment rather than the patch. `evaluate.sh` therefore starts
a local httpbin (`lib/httpbin.sh`) and points the suite at it through the
variable the suite already reads.

What this does not do: it never touches the patch, the test identifiers, the
test file, the dataset, the grading logic, or the report. The exports land in
the archived `eval.sh` and in `test_output.txt` under `set -x`, so any grading
that used them says so in its own log. `evaluate.sh` applies them to
`psf/requests` alone, and to whichever harness produced the patch, so the two
arms stay graded under one rig.

## Scoped image cleanup — the defect that produced every `eval error`

The evaluator's post-run `clean_images` (`swebench/harness/docker_utils.py`)
deletes, at `--cache_level env`, **every** `sweb.eval.*` image on the daemon that
was not present when this process started — not only the instance it graded:

    elif image_name.startswith("sweb.eval"):
        if cache_level in {"none", "base", "env"} and (clean or not existed_before):
            return True

This rig runs the benchmark as concurrent per-instance workers. Grading is
serialized by `.grade-lock`, but *pulling* is not, so worker B's `docker pull`
routinely lands inside worker A's evaluator process — after A's `list_images`
snapshot and before A's cleanup. A then deletes B's freshly pulled image, and B
grades against nothing:

    docker.errors.ImageNotFound: 404 ... No such image: sweb.eval.x86_64...

That is verbatim what `fullbench/manifest.jsonl` recorded as `eval error` for
`django__django-12741`, `django__django-13406`, `django__django-15380` and
`matplotlib__matplotlib-22865` in r90, and it reproduced live on
`astropy__astropy-7166` during the 2026-08-21 codex backfill.

So this narrows the cleanup to the instances this invocation was asked to grade,
by adding every other instance's `sweb.eval` image to the "existed before" set.
It removes no image the evaluator would have kept and keeps no image the
evaluator would have removed *for the instances it graded*; it only stops one
grading from deleting another's. `--cache_level` still decides what happens to
this invocation's own images, and nothing about how a patch is graded changes.
