# Captures one instance's model patch out of its workspace.
#
#   capture-patch.sh <workdir> <out-patch> [extra-exclude-pathspec ...]
#
# The patch is the working tree against the capture base `snapshot-base.sh`
# recorded before the agent started, so it holds what the agent changed and
# nothing the official image had already changed. Two things are excluded here,
# both at the source rather than by editing the patch afterwards:
#
#   1. Files the image's own `pre_install` step mutated. The capture base
#      already contains them, so they cancel.
#   2. Files that did not exist when the agent started. Agent scratch left in
#      the tree would otherwise be reported as a new file — wave 3 shipped
#      `.tmp_init_collect_repro/` with an `assert False` in it. Restoring the
#      index to the capture base drops them, which is also exactly the set the
#      codex path never had in its index, so both harnesses are captured under
#      the same rule.
#
# Anything dropped by rule 2 is listed in <out-patch>.untracked, so a wave can
# see whether a run created a file it meant to keep.
