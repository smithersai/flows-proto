/**
 * Reports a best-of-n matrix: reliability, best-of-n, and selector quality.
 *
 *   node matrix-report.mjs --prefix w12 [--count 5]
 *
 * Reads the official evaluator's own reports — one per round per side, plus one
 * for the selected patches — and the selection rationales the selector wrote
 * before any of them existed. Writes `matrix-report.json` and
 * `matrix-report.md`.
 *
 * Four things it reports, and the disclosure each one owes:
 *
 * 1. **The reliability matrix.** Every instance's n verdicts on each side. It is
 *    the number the single-attempt waves could not produce: a wave that resolves
 *    four of five once has said nothing about whether it resolves them again.
 * 2. **Best-of-n, both sides.** The two are *not* computed the same way and the
 *    report says so on every line that carries them. The flows column is the
 *    verdict of the patch its own journal-only selector chose before grading —
 *    a number the harness could produce in production. The codex column is the
 *    best verdict any of the n earned — `resolved` whenever one of them did —
 *    which is an **oracle**: it is chosen by the grader, no codex run could pick
 *    it, and it is an upper bound on what a codex best-of-n would score.
 *    Reporting them side by side without that sentence would be claiming a win
 *    the measurement does not support.
 * 3. **Selector quality.** Of the instances where at least one flows run
 *    resolved, how often the selector picked a resolving run. This is the flows
 *    column's own oracle gap: `hit` where the selector matched what an oracle
 *    would have taken, `miss` where a resolving patch was available and the
 *    selector took another.
 * 4. **Single attempt.** The r1 column on both sides, which is the same
 *    measurement waves 3 to 11 reported, so the matrix can be read against them.
 *
 * Nothing here spends tokens or needs docker: it is a projection of artifacts a
 * matrix already produced.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
