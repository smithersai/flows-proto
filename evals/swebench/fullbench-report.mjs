/**
 * The full benchmark's running scoreboard, and the checkpoint that appends to
 * its progress log.
 *
 *   node fullbench-report.mjs [--checkpoint] [--manifest f] [--dataset f]
 *                             [--sample f] [--out dir] [--now ms] [--free-mib n]
 *   node fullbench-report.mjs --spend-cents [--manifest f]
 *
 * Everything here is read off `fullbench/manifest.jsonl` and the dataset. It
 * never reads the evaluator's own report files, never re-grades anything, and
 * has no state of its own: running it twice over the same ledger produces the
 * same bytes, which is what makes `fixtures/check-fullbench-report.mjs` able to
 * pin it.
 *
 * Four things it computes that are worth stating outright:
 *
 * - **The resolve rate carries a 95% Wilson interval.** At 25 of 500 graded, 8
 *   resolved is a rate somewhere between 17% and 52%, and a checkpoint that
 *   prints "32%" without that width invites a conclusion the sample cannot
 *   support. Wilson rather than the normal approximation because the interval
 *   has to behave at 0 and at small n, which is exactly where the early
 *   checkpoints are.
 * - **The projected finish comes in two numbers, both labelled.** "Observed" is
 *   the wall clock the ledger actually spans divided by what completed in it,
 *   so it includes every hour the driver was stopped, paused or waiting on
 *   disk. "Modelled" is the mean instance wall divided by the concurrency,
 *   which is what the run would do if nothing ever stopped it. The truth is
 *   between them and the report does not pretend to pick.
 * - **Both denominators travel together.** `lib/excluded.mjs` names the
 *   instances whose verdicts are statements about the grading environment
 *   rather than about a harness. This is a scoreboard over the same ledgers
 *   `compare-runs.mjs` reads, so it obeys the same rule they do: the rate is
 *   over the scored population and every sentence carrying it also carries the
 *   raw count. When a population excludes nothing the numbers are identical and
 *   the report reads exactly as it did before.
 * - **The prefix is a random sample.** Instances run in the seeded draw order,
 *   so the first *k* graded are a uniform draw from the 500 and extrapolating
 *   from them is sound. In dataset order it would not be — the first 231 rows
 *   are django — and the extrapolation lines say which order produced them.
 *
 * `--now` and `--free-mib` exist so the fixture can pin an ETA and a disk
 * figure. Without them this reads the wall clock and shells out to
 * `lib/disk-free.sh`, which is fine here: this is a rig script, not repository
 * code, and the ambient-clock rule the packages follow is about the harness.
