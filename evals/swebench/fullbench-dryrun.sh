# Proves the full-benchmark driver without spending a token.
#
#   ./fullbench-dryrun.sh
#
# `fixtures/check-fullbench.mjs` replays the ledger, the queue and the report
# offline. What it cannot replay is the part that only exists when processes are
# real: pulling and deleting an image, holding the extraction lock, two workers
# in flight, and — the one that matters most — being killed halfway through an
# instance and resuming without re-running what was already graded.
#
# So this runs the real driver, with the real manifest, the real disk gate and
# real docker, over four instances that are in no dataset. The agent is stubbed
# (`SWB_RUN_CMD`) and so is the evaluator (`SWB_GRADE_CMD`); everything between
# them is the code the benchmark runs.
#
# Eight phases. A–C are one four-instance benchmark; F–G are a second, separate
# one, because the crashes they stage are about instances that must not run
# again and the first benchmark's ledger is already pinned by its own
# assertions.
#
#   A  three instances, two in flight, and a `kill -9` while the third is
#      mid-run — the crash a laptop or a closed session produces
#   B  --resume: the two that were graded are skipped, the third re-runs clean
#   D  the disk gate, made to fail: the instance logs its wait and stops rather
#      than pulling into a full disk
#   C  the budget: cumulative cost over the cap PAUSEs the driver instead of
#      quietly spending the rest
#   F  the driver alone is killed and its worker survives it — `pkill -f
#      fullbench.sh` does not match `fullbench-instance.sh` — and the next
#      driver must leave that instance to the worker that is still running it
#      rather than start a second paid attempt beside it
#   H  a verdict left behind by an attempt that died before it could be
#      recorded: the official evaluator skips any instance that already has a
#      report under the run id, so the re-run has to delete that report or it
#      inherits the dead attempt's verdict for a patch it never saw
#   E  an instance that fails after its pull leaves no image behind; the
#      failure path used to keep 2–3 GB for the rest of the run
#   G  an instance killed between `graded` and `docker rmi` is past the resume
#      boundary and is never scheduled again, so the next driver reconciles its
#      image on the way in
#
# Real docker, three tiny images. Which stub instance gets which is decided by
# the seeded draw, the same order the benchmark itself runs in, so the phases
# cannot silently depend on an order the driver does not actually use:
#
#   1st drawn  busybox      pulled, extracted through the rig's extraction lock,
#                           then deleted
#   2nd drawn  hello-world  pulled, empty patch, deleted
#   3rd drawn  alpine       already local, pinned, and still here at the end —
#                           the stand-in for the five images the 5x5 matrix
#                           needs kept warm
#   4th drawn  busybox      never pulled: the disk gate stops it first
#
# Spends no model tokens. Needs docker and about 10 MB of pulls.
