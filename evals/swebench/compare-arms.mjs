/**
 * The two harnesses on one population: who resolved what, and who is missing.
 *
 *   node compare-arms.mjs [--manifest f] [--codex-manifest f] [--out dir] [--json]
 *
 * `analysis/PROGRAM.md` section 4 states the standing goal in one line: **flows
 * must resolve a superset of what codex resolves on the same instances.** That
 * claim is a four-cell table — both, flows-only, codex-only, neither — and this
 * is the only place it is computed, so nobody has to count by hand again.
 *
 * Two rules make the table honest, and both are the reason it is a script rather
 * than a paragraph.
 *
 * **A verdict that is not a grading is not a verdict.** `eval error` says the
 * evaluator never ran the patch; `empty patch` says the agent produced nothing
 * and no container was ever started. Neither is evidence about a harness's
 * ability, and neither may be counted as a loss. So the four-cell table is
 * computed over the **graded intersection** — the instances where *both* arms
 * have a real verdict — and every instance outside it is listed by name and by
 * reason. A superset claim over a population where one arm is missing rows is
 * provisional in both directions, and the report says so in those words.
 *
 * `empty patch` is the one non-grading verdict that still counts. The agent
 * finished and changed nothing; that is a fact about the agent, and it counts as
 * not resolved.
 *
 * **Coverage is stated before the rate.** "23 of 27 (85 %)" and "23 of 45
 * (51 %)" are the same numerator, and quoting the first without the denominator
 * that produced it is how an incomplete arm reads as a better one.
 *
 * **An excluded instance is excluded from both arms.** `lib/excluded.mjs` names
 * the instances whose verdicts are statements about the grading environment
 * rather than about a harness, with the cause on record. They leave the
 * four-cell table for flows and for codex identically — an exclusion that moved
 * one cell and not the other would be tuning, not scoping — they are still
 * listed per instance, and every count here prints the scored number and the
 * raw number together.
 *
 * Reads two ledgers and nothing else: no evaluator report, no journal, no clock,
 * no network. Running it twice over the same files produces the same bytes.
