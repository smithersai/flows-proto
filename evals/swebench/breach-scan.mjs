/**
 * One lane's seal, read back off the lane's own artifacts — for either arm.
 *
 *   node breach-scan.mjs --ledger f [--logs dir] [--journals dir] \
 *     [--label text] [--require none] [--out dir] [--json]
 *
 * `compare-codex-lanes.mjs` asserts the seal on the *codex* arm, as one column
 * of a two-lane comparison. This asks the same question of one lane on its own,
 * and of **either harness**, because from 2026-08-24 both arms run their
 * testbed on `--network none` and a claim made for one arm is worth nothing
 * unless the same evidence is produced for the other.
 *
 * Two assertions, and they are the two halves the `none` lane's report already
 * owes:
 *
 * - **every container was measured `none`.** The ledger carries what the lane
 *   *asked* for (`testbedNetwork`) and what `docker inspect` said the container
 *   was actually on at the instant it started (`testbedNetworkObserved`). The
 *   assertion reads the observation, never the request: a lane that judged
 *   itself by its request would be checking a variable against itself. A row
 *   with no observation at all fails the same way a `bridge` one does — an
 *   unmeasured container is not a sealed container.
 * - **zero successful egress, in every trace.** Under `none` this is redundant,
 *   which is the point: the breach column has to come out zero *by
 *   construction*, and a non-zero one means the constraint did not hold
 *   somewhere the ledger did not see.
 *
 * The patterns are not re-invented here. `egress`, `breaches` and `webSearches`
 * are imported from `compare-codex-lanes.mjs`, so the two reports cannot drift
 * apart on what counts as an attempt or a breach.
 *
 * **Where the trace lives differs per arm, and only that differs.** A codex run
 * writes one transcript, `logs/<id>.run.log`. A flows run writes a driver log of
 * the same name plus a journal, `journals/<id>/engine.db`, whose
 * `flows_journal_events.payload_json` holds every call the agent made and every
 * result it got back. Both are read as text and handed to the same patterns.
 *
 * It reads a ledger, some logs and some journals. No evaluator report, no
 * clock, no network. Running it twice over the same files produces the same
 * bytes.
