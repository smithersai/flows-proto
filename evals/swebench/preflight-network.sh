# Does a `--network none` testbed still let the repositories run their tests?
#
#   ./preflight-network.sh                     # three probes, no tokens

#
# `SWB_TESTBED_NETWORK=none` takes the network away from the container the agent
# runs the project's tests in. That is the point — two `r90s` runs fetched the
# merged upstream fix with a `docker exec <container> curl …`, and a container
# with no route cannot — but it changes what the *agent* can run, so it is
# validated before a lane spends a token rather than explained after one.
#
# The concern is narrow and specific: **a test or a `conftest.py` that reaches
# the network at agent-side run time.** Such a test fails under `none` for a
# reason that has nothing to do with the agent, and an instance whose suite
# cannot run is not a measurement of a harness. `psf__requests-1766` and
# `psf__requests-2317` are already excluded by name for the grading-side version
# of this — they need an httpbin route — so the class is known to be non-empty.
#
# **The evaluator's own grading containers are untouched by any of this.**
# Grading was never the hole: the evaluator runs the graded tests itself, after
# the agent is gone, against a patch. Moving its network would change what a
# verdict means, for every lane ever recorded. This script reads the agent-side
# condition and nothing else.
#
# ## What a probe is
#
# Three pinned, representative instances — one django, one sympy, one astropy —
# booted twice each: once under `--network none`, once under `bridge`. Each boot
# runs that repository's own test command, from the same `lib/test-command.py`
# both prompts are written from, on the **untouched** tree the official image
# ships at the base commit.
#
# The tree is untouched on purpose. The bug is present, so the suite is expected
# to fail, and an exit code on its own says nothing about the network. What the
# probe reads is the **pair**:
#
#   both the same                                  ok       the network is irrelevant here
#   none carries a resolution/connection error      flagged  the suite reaches the network
#     that bridge does not
#   none fails where bridge passes                  flagged  the same finding off the exit status
#   none passes where bridge fails                  noisy    reported, never a network finding
#   both fail the same way                          ok       a pre-existing failure, the normal case
#
# A flagged probe names every scored instance in its repository family, because
# one probe stands for all of them. **Every probe flagged is `SYSTEMIC`**: it
# exits 2 and says so at the top, because a testbed no repository's suite can
# run is a condition to abandon rather than a sandbox to tighten, and finding
# that out is the whole reason this runs first. One flagged probe exits 1. All
# clear exits 0.
#
# **Three probes do not cover eight families, and the report says which ones it
# did not reach rather than letting an all-clear read as coverage.** The scored
# 43 come from astropy, django, matplotlib, psf, pydata, pytest-dev, sphinx-doc
# and sympy; three probes are the sample Will asked for, on the reasoning that a
# `conftest.py` reaching the network is a property of a repository rather than
# of an instance. The uncovered families are printed with their instance counts
# under "not probed", so the number of instances an all-clear actually speaks
# for is on the same screen as the all-clear. `SWB_PREFLIGHT_INSTANCES` widens
# the sample when the answer matters more than the wall clock.
#
# Spends no model tokens. Needs docker and the three images (multi-gigabyte, and
# pulled if absent). `./network-dryrun.sh` drives this script over tiny images
# through `SWB_PREFLIGHT_IMAGE_CMD` and `SWB_PREFLIGHT_TEST_CMD`.
