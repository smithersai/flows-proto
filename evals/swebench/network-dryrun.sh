#   ./network-dryrun.sh
#
# `fixtures/check-testbed-network.mjs` replays the ledger field and the
# scoreboard's assertion offline. What it cannot replay is the part that only
# exists when a daemon is real: whether a `--network none` container can be
# `docker exec`-ed into at all, whether it can reach the network anyway, and
# whether `docker inspect` reports back what the run asked for.
#
# That last question is the whole ruling. The codex arm's environment seal was a
# seal on the tools an agent reaches for, and two `r90s` runs got round it with a
# `docker exec <container> curl …` — the container kept its network, so the
# process the daemon started for that command was never covered. Will ruled on
# 2026-08-24: a proper sandbox, so it cannot cheat. This is where that claim is
# measured rather than asserted.
#
# Four phases:
#
#   A  the physical fact: a `--network none` container has `lo` and nothing
#      else, cannot resolve a name, cannot open a raw IP, and `docker exec`
#      works against it anyway — which it has to, because both arms run the
#      project's tests that way
#   B  the same measurement through `lib/testbed-network.sh`: `resolve` refuses
#      anything but the two values, `observe` reports the fact, and `assert`
#      fails a container that is on the wrong network
#   C  the preflight, driven end to end over tiny images through its two stub
#      hooks: a repository whose suite works without the network clears, one
#      whose suite needs it is flagged, one that fails under both is not a
#      network finding, and every probe flagged says SYSTEMIC and exits 2
#   D  the scoreboard's exit status over a ledger written by the same fields the
#      real runs write
#
# Real docker, one tiny image: `alpine` is pulled if absent and left behind,
# because it is the disk probe's image too.
#
# Spends no model tokens. Needs docker and about 8 MB of pulls.
