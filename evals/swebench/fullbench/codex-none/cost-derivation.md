# Deriving a USD cost for the sealed-testbed codex arm

`r90n` is `r90sh` with one variable moved — `SWB_TESTBED_NETWORK=none`, so the
container the agent runs the project's tests in has `lo` and nothing else — and
it prints the same single `tokens used` footer with no input/cached/output
split. This note derives the split for the `none` lane using the **same method,
the same parameters and the same price table** as
`fullbench/codex-sealed/cost-derivation.md` and
`fullbench/codex-sealed-high/cost-derivation.md`, so the three lanes' dollars
are comparable to each other and not only to themselves.

Read those two notes first. Everything they establish — how a request sequence
is reconstructed from a transcript, why the footer is `Σ (non-cached input) + Σ
output` rather than a cumulative total, why non-cached input telescopes to the
final request's context, and the price table — is reused here and not
re-argued.

**Everything here is a model.** The inputs are 45 archived transcripts
(`fullbench/codex-none/logs/<id>.run.log`), the lane's ledger
(`fullbench/codex-none-manifest.jsonl`), and the committed price table
(`prices.ts`). No billing data exists for this arm either: `codex exec` runs
under `--ephemeral` (`run-instance-codex.sh:196`), so no rollout JSONL with a
real token split survives.

## The method is reproduced, not restated

Neither earlier note published its script, so this note's derivation is a third
re-implementation, and it is calibrated by replaying it over **both** earlier
lanes' transcripts and checking it against their published tables before it is
pointed at anything new.

Requests, tool calls and footers are **exact** on both lanes — the parse is not
in question. The residual is in the character counting, it is under half a
percent on the derived output, and it runs in one direction: this
implementation reads a slightly larger final request, so it derives slightly
**less** output and therefore a slightly **lower** dollar figure than either
published note. Every comparison in this note is between numbers this
implementation produced, so the residual cancels; where a published figure is
quoted beside one of ours, the published one is named as published.

**This note does not publish its script either, and that is now three notes in a
row.** The implementation is a single 170-line ES module at
`~/Desktop/flows-swebench/derive-codex-cost.mjs`; it takes `--logs <dir>`,
`--chars`, `--cap`, `--system` and `--sweep`, reads nothing but the transcripts,
and reproduces every number in this note. The parse is small enough to restate:
split a transcript on its bare marker lines (`user`, `codex`, `exec`, `apply
patch`, `tokens used`), drop the banner before the first `user`, count each
block's characters at `floor(chars / 4)`, treat every `exec` and `apply patch`
block as one tool call whose result — everything after the block's ` succeeded
in …` / ` exited N in …` line — is capped at the tool limit, and emit one
request's input after each tool call. Committing it under `evals/swebench/lib/`
is the right fix and is left to whoever next touches this rig.

The 27-cell sensitivity sweep replays too. **Twenty-five of `r90sh`'s 27 cells
reproduce their published `infeasible` count exactly**, including every cell
that decides a parameter choice: 0 at 4 / 10k / 0, and 1 at both 4 / 10k / 3k
and 4 / 10k / 6k, which is the rejection that forced `r90sh` off the `r90s`
headline parameters. The two that differ — 3.6 / 4k / 6k (0 published, 1 here)
and 3.6 / 16k / 3k (2 published, 3 here) — are corner cells that neither note
selects, and each differs by one run. Across all 27 cells the largest USD-low
disagreement is $0.44, at a corner; at the headline cell it is $0.10.

## Parameters

`chars/token = 4`, `tool-output cap = 10,000 tokens`, `system overhead = 0`.

**That is `r90sh`'s parameter set, kept unchanged so the medium → high → sealed
progression is priced on one basis.** Unlike `r90sh`, this lane does not
*require* it: at 4 / 10k / 3,000 the `none` lane leaves all 45 runs feasible,
so the `r90s` headline set is available here. It is not used, because a
delta between two lanes priced at two parameter sets is a parameter change
wearing a result's clothes.

Setting the system overhead to 0 makes the modeled input a lower bound on
context and therefore the derived output an upper bound, which is the
conservative direction for a cost figure.

## Price

`prices.ts`, verified in file and unchanged: gpt-5.6-sol at **$5.00/M** uncached
input, **$0.50/M** cached input, **$30.00/M** output (reasoning included in
output, not billed twice).

- **USD low (with cache)** — `novel × $5 + cached × $0.50 + output × $30`.
- **USD high (no cache)** — `total_input × $5 + output × $30`.

## What the sealed testbed did to the reconstruction

Both lanes priced at 4 / 10k / 0 by this one implementation, so nothing below is
a parameter artefact or a cross-implementation artefact:

| | `r90sh` (testbed `bridge`) | `r90n` (testbed `none`) | change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| tool calls | 684 | 683 | −0.1 % |
| requests | 729 | 728 | −0.1 % |
| footer tokens | 1,982,783 | 2,008,260 | +1.3 % |
| modeled input | 11,920,995 | 12,223,281 | +2.5 % |
| cached share | 90.7 % | 91.1 % | +0.4 pt |
| output+reasoning | 876,706 | 924,763 | +5.5 % |
| agent wall clock (ledger, raw 45) | 6,229 s | 5,415 s | **−13.1 %** |
| USD low, raw 45 | $37.24 | **$38.73** | **+4.0 %** |
| USD low, scored 43 | $35.81 | **$37.38** | **+4.4 %** |
| runs whose implied output goes negative | 0 | 0 | — |

**Taking the network away from the testbed made the lane slightly dearer and
noticeably faster.** The same number of requests carried 1.3 % more footer
tokens and 5.5 % more derived output, while the agent's own wall clock fell
13 %. The reading the artifacts support is that the eight `r90sh` runs that
fetched upstream hindsight spent wall clock waiting on the network and then
short-cut the reasoning; without that route the lane thinks a little more and
waits a lot less. It is consistent, it is not proof, and no artifact in this
tree can settle it.

**The ratio is steadier than the level.** Pricing both lanes at every setting
and taking `r90n ÷ r90sh`:

| | value |
| --- | --- |
| settings feasible in **both** lanes | 15 of 27 |
| `r90n ÷ r90sh` across those 15 | **1.038 – 1.054** |
| `r90n ÷ r90sh` across all 27, feasible or not | 1.038 – 1.060 |

**What sealing the testbed cost in dollars is a +4 % ±1 % answer whichever
feasible parameter set you pick**, even though the absolute level moves by a
quarter across the band.

⟂ marks an instance `lib/excluded.mjs` keeps out of every rate, for both arms.

Scored population (43, excluding `psf__requests-1766` and `psf__requests-2317`
by name): **$37.38** low, **$86.25** high, over 699 requests and 1,932,431
footer tokens, at a 91.3 % cached share and 891,544 derived output tokens.

Per instance: mean $0.8607 low / $1.9747 high; range $0.4825–$2.2930 low
(`r90sh`'s was $0.4208–$1.9931, `r90s`'s $0.2897–$1.3391).

## Sensitivity

The three modelling parameters, swept together, exactly as both earlier notes
sweep them. `infeasible` counts runs whose implied output goes negative; a
setting with any is rejected.

**Twenty-two of the 27 settings are feasible for this lane** — more than
`r90sh`'s 16 — and across them the total runs **$34.03 to $43.41** with cache
and **$83.33 to $101.27** without. The headline $38.73 sits near the middle of
that band, not at an edge.

## The dominant uncertainty is still cache efficiency, and it still points down

The per-run model assumes ideal prefix caching, which reaches a lane-wide
**91.1 %** cached share (against `r90sh`'s 90.7 % and `r90s`'s 89.4 %). Because
the footer pins `non-cached input + output`, a worse cache means more non-cached
input and necessarily *less* output, and output bills at 6× input, so **worse
caching implies a lower derived cost, not a higher one**.

Applying a single uniform cached share to the whole lane, which is coarser than
the per-run telescoping model and so rules out more:

| assumed cached share | non-cached input | implied output | output per request | total USD | verdict |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 84.0 % | 1,955,725 | 52,535 | 72 | $16.49 | 7 runs negative — ruled out |
| 86.0 % | 1,711,259 | 297,001 | 408 | $22.72 | 6 runs negative — ruled out |
| 88.0 % | 1,466,794 | 541,466 | 744 | $28.96 | 6 runs negative — ruled out |
| 89.5 % | 1,283,445 | 724,815 | 996 | $33.63 | 3 runs negative — ruled out |
| 90.5 % | 1,161,212 | 847,048 | 1,164 | $36.75 | 3 runs negative — ruled out |
| **91.1 % (ideal, per run)** | **1,083,497** | **924,763** | **1,270** | **$38.73** | feasible |

The footers are only jointly satisfiable near the ideal split, so $38.73 is a
point estimate rather than the top of a wide band — and on the cache axis
specifically it is a **ceiling**.

## Against the flows arm

The flows arm needs no modelling: `fullbench/rerun-r97/journals` records all four
token counters per model call, and `lib/run-cost.mjs` read over the 45 journals
gives **$25.5223 raw (45) / $24.7018 scored (43)** — 5,474,701 input tokens of
which 1,797,620 (32.8 %) cached, 207,940 output (98,337 of it reasoning), over
303 model calls. That figure is independently reproduced by the ledger's own
per-instance `cost.usd` rows to the last cent, because both come from the same
journal projection.

| arm | testbed | basis | raw (45) | scored (43) |

**Sealed codex cost about $38.73 against flows' measured $25.52 — 1.52×
dearer.** Across the 22 feasible settings that ratio runs 1.33×–1.70×, so it
does not turn on a parameter choice. The driver is unchanged from both earlier
notes and the sealed testbed did not move it: codex spent 728 requests to flows'
303 model calls, and about 1,270 derived output tokens per request against flows'
measured 686 per call — 924,763 output tokens against 207,940, at $30/M.

**The comparison's own caveat travels with it.** The flows column is `r97`,
which ran before `SWB_TESTBED_NETWORK=none` was recorded, so the two arms in
that table are not under one condition. The lane that would fix it, `r98`, is
void — see `fullbench/rerun-r98/VOID.json` — and its 10 attempted instances are
not a rate. What can be said about the flows column's exposure is in the
scoreboard, not here: `breach-scan.mjs` over `r97`'s ledger, driver logs and
journals counts **zero in-container fetches across all 45 runs**, and the only
two egress commands the scan finds anywhere in the lane are `pip install Pillow`
in `django__django-13343`.

## What would falsify this

Unchanged from both earlier notes: one `codex exec` run with `--json`, or
without `--ephemeral`, prints `input_tokens` / `cached_input_tokens` /
`output_tokens` beside the footer and replaces this derivation with a
measurement. `run-instance-codex.sh:196` passes `--ephemeral`, which is why no
archived run of any of the three sealed lanes can be appealed to. Dropping that
flag on the next codex wave is the whole fix.
