# Proves the codex backfill without spending a token.
#
#   ./codex-backfill-dryrun.sh
#
# `fixtures/check-codex-backfill.mjs` replays the queue and the ledger offline.
# What it cannot replay is the part that only exists when processes are real:
# the two-slot semaphore under three concurrent `--one` invocations, a real
# `docker pull` and `docker rmi`, and — the one that matters most — one of those
# invocations being killed with `-9` halfway through and the next one picking its
# instance back up.
#
# So this runs the real script, with the real ledger, the real disk gate and real
# docker, over five instances that are in no dataset. The agent is stubbed
# (`SWB_CODEX_RUN_CMD`), the evaluator is stubbed (`SWB_GRADE_CMD`) and the auth
# check is stubbed (`SWB_CODEX_AUTH_CMD`); everything between them is the code
# the backfill runs.
#
# Seven phases:
#
#   A  a logged-out rig: the auth check fails loudly and nothing is claimed,
#      pulled or written
#   B  three `--one` invocations at once: two run, the third waits for a slot,
#      and the ledger never shows three in flight
#   C  `kill -9` on one invocation mid-instance leaves a `started` row with no
#      verdict — the row that says how far it got and that it is still owed
#   D  the next invocation of that id runs it again from the top and reaches a
#      verdict; an id that already has one is a no-op that touches no docker
#   E  a disk gate that cannot be satisfied logs its wait and fails the instance
#      rather than pulling into a full disk
#   F  the failed instance is retried, and the report its dead attempt left
#      behind is deleted rather than read: the official evaluator skips an
#      instance that already has one, so inheriting it would file a verdict for
#      a patch that attempt never produced
#   G  an id the full benchmark never graded is refused; a bare backfill works
#      its way through what is left; and one with nothing left says so and
#      exits 0
#
# Real docker, three tiny images: `busybox` is pulled and deleted, `hello-world`
# is pulled and deleted, and `alpine` stands in for a pinned instance's image and
# is still here at the end.
#
# Spends no model tokens. Needs docker and about 10 MB of pulls.
