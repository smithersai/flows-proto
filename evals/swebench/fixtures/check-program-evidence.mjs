/**
 * Replays `lib/program-evidence.mjs` over a synthesised journal.
 *
 * The re-run report claims that particular `analysis/PROGRAM.md` changes acted,
 * and every one of those claims is a count this module takes off the journal.
 * A miscount would be invisible in the report and would read as evidence, so
 * the counts are pinned here against a journal whose every event is known.
 *
 * What is pinned:
 *
 * - a frame that issues no call is a **zero-call frame**, and one that applies
 *   no transition is a **dead frame**, and the two are counted separately
 *   because change #1 removes the first and change #5 the second;
 * - a **failed call is not the end of its cell**: a cell that settles another
 *   call after one fails, or that still applies a transition, is counted as
 *   the recovery change #8 exists to produce;
 * - a `bash` call carrying `script` or `stdin` is **script-as-data** and one
 *   carrying `command` is not, which is the whole of change #4's prediction;
 * - `recall` ordinals and `render` keys are counted per transition, so
 *   change #1's "never re-buy what you paid for" has a number;
 * - a `test` call naming `against: "base"` is a **baselined** one (change #6);
 * - and a failed `edit`/`write`/`apply_patch` is a failed mutation (change #3).
 *
 * Spends nothing, needs no docker, needs no dataset.
