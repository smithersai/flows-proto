/**
 * Pins the per-run artifact names, on both harnesses.
 *
 * `lib/run-paths.sh` is the one place that knows where a run's workspace, patch,
 * timings, logs, container and journal go. Two things depend on it being exactly
 * right and neither shows up as a test failure anywhere else: a matrix run of
 * five attempts must name five distinct sets, and a run without an index must
 * name what every existing script already reads — `regen-patch.sh`,
 * `scorecard.ts --work work`, and every wave report that quotes a path.
 *
 * It also pins the symmetry the comparison rests on: the codex side's names are
 * the flows side's names under the codex roots, so a matrix manifest from either
 * harness has the same shape.
 *
 * Spends no tokens, needs no docker, needs no dataset.
