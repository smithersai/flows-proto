/**
 * Replays `n-way.mjs` over four synthesised ledgers.
 *
 * The n-column scoreboard is `three-way.mjs` with the arity taken out, so it
 * inherits that reader's two ways of being wrong and adds one of its own:
 *
 * - **recovered is not gained.** An instance the baseline resolved, some wave
 *   since dropped, and the last wave holds again is a recovery. An instance no
 *   wave before the last ever resolved is a gain. Counting the first as the
 *   second is how a wave that undid a regression gets reported as progress.
 * - **still lost is about the last wave only.** With four columns there is more
 *   than one way for an instance to have been lost in between, and none of them
 *   is the question: what the next report has to answer for is what the
 *   baseline resolved and the newest wave does not.
 * - **every column is that wave's own fold.** The dollars are every attempt,
 *   the wall clocks are the two `compare-runs.mjs` labels, and the baseline
 *   column reads identically no matter which wave it was computed against —
 *   which is the check that the columns are one rule applied n times.
 * - **an excluded instance is in no movement row and in every printed
 *   denominator**, exactly as the three-column reader has it.
 *
 * Spends nothing, needs no docker, needs no dataset.
