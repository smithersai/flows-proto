/**
 * The sealed testbed, offline: the condition, the ledger field, and the
 * assertion the scoreboard makes out of them.
 *
 * The codex arm's environment seal was a seal on the tools an agent reaches
 * for. `shell_environment_policy.set` poisons the proxy variables of the
 * commands codex spawns on the host; a `docker exec <container> curl …` starts
 * its process as the docker daemon's child, inside a container that had the
 * network on. Two of the 45 `r90s` runs used exactly that to fetch the merged
 * upstream fix, and `r90sh` repeated it. Will ruled on 2026-08-24 that the
 * testbed gets a proper sandbox so it cannot cheat.
 *
 * What is pinned here is everything about that ruling which does not need
 * docker:
 *
 * - **the rule lives in one file.** Both run scripts resolve the condition
 *   through `lib/testbed-network.sh`, pass it to their `docker run`, and assert
 *   it back off the live container before an agent starts. A run script that
 *   grew its own `--network` literal would be a second rule.
 * - **the request and the observation are separate fields.** `testbedNetwork`
 *   is what the lane asked for; `testbedNetworkObserved` is what
 *   `docker inspect` said. A report that could only print the request would be
 *   printing a claim, so the scoreboard reads the observation.
 * - **a `none` lane is asserted, not described.** Every attempted row must have
 *   observed `none`, and every transcript must be free of in-container fetches.
 *   A row that observed `bridge`, a row that observed nothing, and a transcript
 *   with a breach each fail the lane, and the failure reaches the exit status
 *   rather than only the prose.
 * - **a `bridge` or unrecorded lane is unchanged.** The three lanes that ran
 *   before the field existed still render exactly as they did, with the hole
 *   they always had, and nothing about them is retroactively re-graded.
 * - **`mixed` is fatal on its own.** A lane whose rows disagree about their
 *   testbed is not one measurement.
 * - **the lane table is a quadruple now.** `sealed-high` and `none` share a
 *   network condition *and* an effort, so the uniqueness rule the rig already
 *   applied to the pair has to apply to the triple or the two lanes would read
 *   as one measurement under two names.
 *
 * The half that needs processes and a real daemon — `docker exec` working
 * against a `--network none` container, the inspect readback, the preflight
 * probe's two boots — is `./network-dryrun.sh`.
 *
 * Spends nothing, needs no docker, needs no dataset.
