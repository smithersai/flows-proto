 * the same fixture wave three more times over copied timings — one instance
 * stamped with a different subject, one instance stamped with none, and a pin
 * that has moved since the instances ran — and checks the `agreement` line says
 * so each time.
 *
 * This is the assertion that makes the preconditions block worth reading. A
 * block that reports whatever it is handed would have printed a single tidy
 * stamp for wave 6, whose harness source changed three times in the two hours
 * around it.
