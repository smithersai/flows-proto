/**
 * Replays the two-arm scoreboard over synthesised ledgers.
 *
 * The superset claim — flows resolves everything codex resolves, and possibly
 * more — is a four-cell table, and the two ways to get it wrong are both about
 * what counts as a verdict:
 *
 * - **`eval error` is not a loss.** The evaluator never ran the patch, so an
 *   instance carrying one belongs outside the table, named, on whichever side it
 *   happened. Counting it as unresolved manufactures a codex-only or a
 *   flows-only cell out of a docker fault.
 * - **`empty patch` is a loss.** The agent finished and changed nothing, and no
 *   container was ever needed to know that.
 *
 * Also pinned: the coverage line is stated before any rate, and the claim is
 * marked provisional whenever either arm is missing gradings — an incomplete arm
 * with a good rate is the easiest wrong conclusion in the whole rig.
 *
 * Spends nothing, needs no docker, needs no dataset.
