/**
 * Replays `three-way.mjs` over three synthesised ledgers.
 *
 * The three-column scoreboard exists because a second re-run has two questions
 * to answer at once, and each has a way of being answered wrongly that would
 * look like data:
 *
 * - **recovered is not gained.** An instance the baseline resolved, the middle
 *   wave dropped and this one holds again is a recovery. An instance no wave
 *   before this one ever resolved is a gain. Counting the first as the second
 *   is how a surgery that merely undid a regression gets reported as progress.
 * - **still lost is not newly lost.** An instance the baseline resolved and
 *   neither re-run does is a regression this wave did not fix; one the middle
 *   wave resolved and this one does not is a regression this wave introduced.
 *   They belong in different rows because they call for different work.
 * - **the middle column is the middle ledger's own fold**, not a re-derivation:
 *   its dollars are every attempt, exactly as `compare-runs.mjs` counts them.
 * - **an excluded instance is in none of the four movement rows and in every
 *   printed denominator.** A verdict a grading environment decided is not a
 *   recovery, a gain, a still-lost or a newly-lost — and hiding it would be
 *   worse than counting it, so the raw totals sit under the scored ones and the
 *   per-instance row stays and is marked.
 *
 * Spends nothing, needs no docker, needs no dataset.
