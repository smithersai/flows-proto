/**
 * Replays the matrix report over recorded evaluator verdicts.
 *
 * The report generator does arithmetic on other people's numbers, and the two
 * things that can go wrong with it are both silent: a cell read as the wrong
 * verdict, and a best-of-n column computed the same way on both sides when the
 * two sides are not the same measurement. Both are checked here against
 * `fixtures/matrix-reports.json`, which is the verdicts waves 7 to 11 and the
 * drive's four codex gradings actually recorded, replayed as five rounds.
 *
 * Two inputs are constructed rather than recorded, because no best-of-5 has been
 * graded yet: the `selected` verdicts and the instance `stub__never`. They are
 * here to exercise the three answers the selector column can give — hit, miss,
 * and nothing to hit — and the rig fault the generator has to shout about, which
 * is one patch graded twice with two different answers.
 *
 * Spends no tokens, needs no docker, needs no dataset.
