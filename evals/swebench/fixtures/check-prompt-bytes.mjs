/**
 * Replays `lib/prompt-bytes.sh` over a synthesised wave.
 *
 * The number this script prints goes into a wave report as "what the prompts
 * weighed in the wild", so the two ways it could lie are pinned here: reading
 * the wrong interpreter out of the log, and rendering a prompt for an instance
 * the wave did not run. Both would look like data.
 *
 * What is pinned:
 *
 * - one row per `project interpreter` line, in the log's own order, and none
 *   for the instances that only appear in other lines;
 * - a container that answered nothing usable renders **without** the
 *   interpreter bullet and reports `none`, which is smaller than the same
 *   instance with the bullet — the wave stated no fact, so the report may not
 *   claim one;
 * - the summary line counts and totals exactly the rows above it.
 *
 * Needs the evaluator venv, because the prompt names the repository's own test
 * command and `lib/test-command.py` is the only thing that knows it. Spends no
 * tokens and needs no docker.
