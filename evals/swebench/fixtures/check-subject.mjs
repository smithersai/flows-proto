/**
 * Asserts the subject fingerprint states facts rather than assumptions.
 *
 *   node fixtures/check-subject.mjs
 *
 * Three things are pinned here, all offline and all free.
 *
 * The first is the module-resolution fact the whole design rests on: the built
 * CLI loads every `@smthrs/*` dependency from its `src` directory, because that
 * is where the workspace `exports` map points, and only `@smthrs/cli` itself is
 * loaded from a build. If someone gives a package a `dist`-shaped `exports` map
 * without building it in the preflight, this fails.
 *
 * The second is that the pin is enforced: `--expect` accepts a matching stamp
 * and rejects a stale one, which is what every `flows.sh` invocation relies on
 * to notice a sibling lane editing the harness mid-wave.
 *
 * The third is that the HEAD comparison agrees with git in both directions, so
 * `dirty-subject` cannot quietly stop reporting.
 *
 * The fourth is that the stamp covers `packages/cli/src`. That package is the
 * only one whose loaded bytes are a build, so it is the only one whose source
 * can drift away from what runs; leaving it out of the stamp is what let a
 * mid-wave CLI edit pass the pin when the same edit to any other package would
 * have stopped the wave. Held with `stampOf` against a changed input rather
 * than by writing into a shared working tree.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
