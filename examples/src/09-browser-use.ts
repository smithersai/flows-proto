/**
 * Use the library from a browser bundle.
 *
 * Every import in this file comes from an entry point that the repository's
 * browser gate (`pnpm run browser`) bundles with esbuild `platform: "browser"`:
 * the `@smthrs/engine`, `@smthrs/keys`, `@smthrs/journal`, and
 * `@smthrs/platform-browser` roots never statically resolve a `node:`
 * built-in, because platform access lives in layers, and the Node and Bun
 * bundles are their own packages.
 *
 * The barrel `@smthrs/flows` and `@smthrs/engine-store` are Node entry points,
 * so a browser app imports the per-package roots, as this file does. The test
 * for this example bundles the file itself for the browser and fails if a
 * Node-only import ever sneaks in.
