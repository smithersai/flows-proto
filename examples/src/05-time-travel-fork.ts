/**
 * Fork a finished run at a journal frame and drive the copy.
 *
 * Forking is one call on one service: `yield* TimeTravel` and then
 * `fork(position)`. A position is a run id and a frame — the `(lineageId, seq)`
 * address in the journal — and nothing else. The child run id, the lineage
 * edge back to the parent, and the jj workspace the copy lands in are derived
 * inside the service; the parent is checked for liveness there too.
 *
 * Under the fork, `SqlTimeTravelStore.createFork` derives the parent's
 * executable state AT the frame and copies only the attempt rows the frame's
 * journal prefix can explain. Because those attempts are addressed by sealed
 * cache key, the fork replays them instead of dispatching again, which is why
 * the counter below stays at one. The frame here is the parent's last committed
 * sequence, so the fork inherits everything.
 *
 * The environment declaration matters. A sealed cache key is computed under
 * `Action.CurrentCacheEnvironment`; with no declaration the engine scopes
 * the key to the execution that produced it, and the fork would re-execute.
