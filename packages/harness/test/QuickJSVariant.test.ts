/**
 * The QuickJS build is a seam a host can name.
 *
 * The default compiles the single-file build from bytes, which is what Node and
 * a browser want. Cloudflare's workerd refuses that: the only WebAssembly it
 * runs is a module its toolchain compiled and handed to the worker as an
 * import. So the host builds the variant and the sandbox compiles whatever it
 * is given.
 *
 * These cases stand in for that host. They read the `.wasm` file of the
 * separate-file build, compile it here, and hand the module to
 * `newVariant`, which is exactly the shape a worker's `import wasm from
 * "...wasm"` produces. What is pinned is that a cell runs against it.

 * are read and compiled here; what reaches `newVariant` is the same thing
 * either way, and it is the compiled module rather than the bytes.
 *
 * `wasmLocation` names a file that does not exist, which is what makes these
 * cases mean anything. The separate-file build can find its own `.wasm` on a
 * Node filesystem, so a variant that only carried `wasmModule` would still run
 * if the option were ignored. With nowhere to load from, a cell that completes
 * can only have run against the module named here — the same position workerd
