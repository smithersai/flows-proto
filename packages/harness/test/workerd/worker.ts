/**
 * The workerd smoke: one cell, run inside Cloudflare's runtime.
 *
 * workerd runs no WebAssembly it did not compile itself. `WebAssembly.compile`
 * over bytes is refused at runtime, so the single-file build the sandbox
 * defaults to cannot load here. What workerd does accept is a `.wasm` module
 * the toolchain bundled, imported like any other module, and that is what this
 * worker hands the sandbox: `newVariant(base, { wasmModule })` names the
 * imported module and `QuickJSSandbox.layerVariant` puts it behind the seam.
 *
 * The cell calls a flow and then completes, so a passing response means the
 * realm opened, the host bridge settled a call, and the transition came back.
 *
 * See `packages/harness/README.md` for how to run this.
