/**
 * The unanswered-failure relation: what counts as a failure, what counts as
 * going back to it, and which pair a demand names.
 *
 * The cases that matter most are the refusals. This demand is one step from a
 * rule that would fire on every run that ever saw a red check and moved on —
 * which is a rule about whose failures matter, and the harness does not get to
 * decide that. So the relation is pinned in both directions: it holds when the
 * run returned to the subject that failed, and it declines when the run walked
 * away from it, when the failing reading was stamped by a frame that also
 * edited, when the flow said its own call was broken, and when the tree the
 * check ran over is not the tree being submitted.
