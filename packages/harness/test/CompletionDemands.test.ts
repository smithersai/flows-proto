/**
 * The four completion demands, replayed over the two waves they were designed
 * against.
 *
 * The first fixture is the five journals of SWE-bench wave 9, distilled by
 * `evals/swebench/lib/narrowing-journals.mjs` to exactly what the detectors
 * read: every settled call's flow, input and outcome, what its result said
 * about its subject's exit status and about whether it ran a check at all, the
 * digest each frame closed on and whether that frame moved the tree, and the
 * digest the run opened on. Nothing here is a reconstruction: every field is
 * copied out of a `control.agent.*` event or a `workspace-open` boundary.
 *
 * Three of those runs resolved their instance. The demands must be silent on
 * all three, and this file is where that is enforced: a change to any detector
 * that starts asking something of `astropy__astropy-8707`,
 * `pydata__xarray-7393` or `sphinx-doc__sphinx-11445` has to explain itself
 * against real journals rather than against a memory of what a wave once did.
 * `astropy__astropy-8707` is the sharpest of the three — it ran a broad check
 * after its edit, was told "2 failed, 148 passed", and completed anyway, which
 * is why `UnresolvedFailure` is not a rule about failing checks.
 *
 * The two that did not resolve are the two the demands were written for.
 * `django__django-16612` completed after seven frames that made no editing call
 * of any kind, on the digest it opened on, with a sentence describing an edit;
 * its captured patch was zero bytes. `pytest-dev__pytest-6197` ran
 * `pytest -rA testing/python/collect.py` after its final edit, was told "2
 * failed, 72 passed", ran four named cases out of that same file, was told "4
 * passed", and completed on the second reading.
 *
 * The second fixture is wave 10, distilled the same way, and the fourth demand
 * — `NarrowedCheck.findOnly` — was read off it. Together the two files are
 * every completion two graded waves produced, and the whole set is replayed
 * through one driver so a detector that starts asking something new of a run
 * that resolved has to explain itself against ten real journals.
 *
 * The replay drives the detectors directly rather than the loop, for the same
 * reason `NarrowedCheck.test.ts` does: the loop needs a model, a sandbox and an
 * engine, and none of those decide anything here.

/**
 * The same four detectors, replayed over the next wave.
 *
 * Wave 10 is the first wave run with all three completion demands armed, and it
 * is where the fourth came from. Its record: astropy and sphinx resolved,
 * django completed twice over a tree it never moved and shipped an empty patch,
 * xarray never completed at all, and pytest lost the same instance for a fourth
 * consecutive wave — this time by editing correctly, running
 * `pytest -rA testing/test_collection.py -k "collect_init_tests or
 * collect_pkg_init_only"`, and completing on it. That command names the file
 * holding the one test the patch broke, the filter deselects it, and the run
 * never ran that file any other way. `NarrowedCheck.find` compares a completion
 * against the broader checks the run already took and there were none, which is
 * the hole `findOnly` closes.
 *
 * Two instances of the fixture matter beyond the one that fires. Sphinx's
 * completing frame is the shape a par round has — chmod, edit, compile, replay
 * the probe byte for byte, run two whole test files, diff — and it must be left
 * alone. Astropy's completing frame made no call at all, which is the other way
 * a run reaches `complete` with nothing for this detector to read.
