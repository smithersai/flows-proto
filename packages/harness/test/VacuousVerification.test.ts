/**
 * The signal, replayed over the whole r92 full-benchmark wave.
 *
 * The driver is the controller's own ordering: a frame's checks are its
 * successful non-writing calls, the epoch is the run's count of frames that
 * changed the workspace before this one, the pristine ledger stops growing at
 * the first of those, and the reading is taken on every transition that settled
 * with durable state — a `continue` or a `complete`, which is where the
 * controller takes it too.
 *
 * It speaks to three of the forty-five, once each, and those three are the
 * whole argument for stating a fact rather than refusing a frame.
 *
 * `django__django-14351` is the run it was written for, and the only one of the
 * three that lost its verdict. Its journal is unambiguous: one verification
 * script settled at frame 5 with nothing yet changed and exited 0, the same
 * script settled again at frame 14 after the edit and exited 0, and the frame
 * that completed stored it as `state.verification`. The report that lost that
 * verdict twice calls it an empty proof; this is the reading that says so from
 * the record.
 *
 * `django__django-11299` **resolved**, and it resolved by fixing this itself.
 * At frame 3 it stored a script it had watched exit 0 on the untouched tree,
 * then went on working, found a command that failed before its edit and passed
 * after it, stored that instead, and completed on it at frame 10. A harness
 * that had refused frame 3 would have bounced a run that was already correcting
 * itself; one sentence on frame 4 costs it nothing.
 *
 * `django__django-12741` **resolved**, and it was right to complete on a check
 * that had always been green: the task is a signature change with no bug to
 * reproduce, so no command in that tree can fail before the edit and pass
 * after. The fact is still true and the notice still says it — and the escape
 * it names, *keep it and say in your output that it never failed and why*, is
 * this run's case exactly. It is the reason this is not a gate.
