/**
 * The proof that was already true before anything changed.
 *
 * **This control is not wired into `CellTurn`. Nothing in a production run
 * reads it, and no run is told anything by it.** The module, this suite and
 * `AgentEvent.VacuousVerificationObserved` are kept intact so it can be
 * measured on its own, in its own wave, against the contract text r92
 * measured. Everything below describes what it does when an arm turns it on.
 *
 * It was live for exactly one wave. `fullbench/reports/rerun-r93.md` §1 reads
 * the result off the 45 journals, and the reason it is off is that the wave
 * cannot price it:
 *
 * - It fired **twice in 45 journals**, and on neither of the instances the
 *   diagnosis or the replay predicted. `django__django-14351`, the run it was
 *   written for, resolved that wave with **no observation on its journal at
 *   all** — so the row it was built to close was closed by something else, and
 *   two prompt rules landed in the same round.
 * - `sympy__sympy-13878` is the firing that worked: told at frame 1 that its
 *   stored check was already green, the run replaced it, spent seventeen more
 *   frames on a different proof, and resolved — cheaper and in fewer frames
 *   than any earlier wave.
 * - `django__django-15732` is the firing that did not. The observation landed
 *   on frame 7, which is the frame that made the correct edit. On frame 8 the
 *   run made a second edit that rewrote the enclosing block and restored the
 *   first edit's text **byte for byte**. Both edits reported `mutated: true`
 *   on an `observed` basis, the final tree equalled the base, and the captured
 *   diff was zero bytes. The instance had resolved in r90, r91 and r92; it is
 *   the wave's only empty patch.
 *
 * Nothing in this module's contract asks a run to revert, and one instance is
 * not a mechanism. But it is the first evidence that a fact delivered on the
 * `invalidProbe` channel can be read by a run as an instruction to retreat,
 * and the one consequential firing in the wave preceded the wave's only
 * revert-to-empty-patch. Two firings is not a rate. Turning this back on is a
 * wave of its own — this control alone, on r92's contract text, with
 * `django__django-15732` and `sympy__sympy-13878` as the rows to read — and
 * not a change that rides along with another.
 *
 * A run is asked to store the check it verified with as
 * `state.verification: { flow, input }` and to re-run that exact check after
 * its edit. Nothing in that rule says the check ever failed. A run may pick a
 * command that was green on the tree it was handed, watch it stay green after
 * the edit, and complete citing a before-and-after that never moved.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical either. `django__django-14351` lost a baseline
 * verdict across two waves, and its journal says why in two rows: the same
 * verification script — one content digest — ran at sequence 260, before any
 * frame of the run had changed a byte, and exited 0; then again at sequence
 * 582, after the edit, and exited 0. Both readings are true and the pair
 * establishes nothing. The contract already says the words — *a command
 * becomes evidence only once you have SEEN it fail on the unmodified tree* —
 * and the run stored a check it had watched pass there instead.
 *
 * The harness can see this without re-running anything. It already records
 * every check a frame ran, whether that check reported a passing exit status,
 * and how many frames of the run had changed the workspace when it ran. A
 * check that passed while that count was zero, in a frame that itself changed
 * nothing, is a check that passed on the tree the run was handed. If a later
 * cell stores that exact call as its verification, the run is standing on a
 * proof that cannot distinguish its own change from no change at all.
 *
 * One reading takes it back: the same call reported *failing* over that same
 * untouched tree. Then the run has watched the red the contract asks for, and a
 * second, green reading of it before any edit says the command is unsteady
 * rather than that the run never saw it fail. Such a signature is never
 * admitted, so the observation can only ever be made about a check this run has
 * no pre-edit failure for.
 *
 * So the harness says so, and does nothing else. It is delivered on the
 * `invalidProbe` channel — the one place the loop already contradicts a
 * reading of a result the flow itself could see through — because it is the
 * same class of fact: a result that reads identically on a broken tree and on
 * a fixed one. No bounce, no demand, no cap: the run continues on the
 * transition it wrote. A harness that refused the completion would be grading
 * the agent's work with its own, which is the line every control in this
 * package holds, and it would be refusing on a *guess* — a check that was
 * green before an edit is the right check for a task whose bug is a crash the
 * command never reached, and only the run knows which it has.
 *
 * It fires at most once per distinct verification input. The fact is about a
 * call, the record only grows, and a run that has been told and stored the
 * same check again has decided, which is its decision to make.

 * taken now says nothing about the tree the run was handed. `stable` is the

 * edits in anything the harness records, so a check from a frame that also
 * edited might have run on either side of it. `Sufficiency` refuses the same
 * stamp for the same reason; see `NarrowedCheck` `Check` `stable`.
 *
 * `failed` is the third, and it is the one that keeps the observation from
 * contradicting the record it is read off. A check the run has already watched
 * *fail* over the tree it was handed is a check the run has done the contract's
 * work on, whatever it printed the second time: it is red on the unmodified
 * tree, and a later green reading of it at the same epoch says the command is
 * unsteady, not that the run never saw it fail. Telling such a run its proof
 * was "already green" would be a sentence its own journal refutes, so the
 * signature is refused on the way in and evicted if an earlier pass already put
 * it there. The list is the run's failing-check ledger read at epoch zero —
 * `Sufficiency` already keeps it, stamped with the epoch each failure was
 * watched in — so nothing new is measured or stored for this. That ledger is
 * bounded, so a run with more distinct pre-edit failures than `Sufficiency`
 * retains can forget one; forgetting can cost the refusal and can never invent
 * a pass.
 *
 * A repeated signature keeps its first entry rather than taking a second slot:
 * the entries are all the same tree, so re-running one adds no information and
 * re-stamping it would only cost the ledger its oldest genuinely distinct pass.
