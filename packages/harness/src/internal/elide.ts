/**
 * Honest shortening.
 *
 * Every place this harness puts bytes in front of a model is bounded, and every
 * one of those bounds used to be spelled the same way: slice, append `…`, move
 * on. A model reading that cannot tell a value that ends in an ellipsis from a
 * value that was cut, cannot tell how much it lost, and — the expensive part —
 * cannot tell how to get the rest back, so it buys the same bytes again. Three
 * of the five most expensive instances of the r90 wave spent real money
 * re-fetching a region the run had already rendered and silently clipped
 * (`pydata__xarray-7229` $0.76, `sphinx-doc__sphinx-8721` $0.36,
 * `pytest-dev__pytest-6197` $0.19).
 *
 * So a shortened value states three things: that it was shortened, how many
 * bytes are missing, and the id that brings them back. The id is a sentence the
 * caller supplies, because only the caller knows whether the thing is a state
 * key (`render`), a settled call (`recall`), or something the model must fetch
 * again.

/**
 * Shortens an already-shortened text from the middle, counting against the

 * A value can be bounded twice: once where the host copies it out of the

 * statements that share it. Counting the second reduction against what survived
 * the first would report a value as smaller than it is — the exact dishonesty
 * this module exists to abolish — so `whole` is stated by the caller, which is
 * the only place that still knows it, and the notice always names the original
 * size.
