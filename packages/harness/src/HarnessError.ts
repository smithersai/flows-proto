 * `Schema.Defect()`, the projection the rest of the repo uses for the same
 * problem: the value stays untouched in process, and the encode projects an
 * `Error` to its name, message, and cause and anything else to a JSON-safe
 * form. A plain `Schema.Unknown` fails the encode with `Expected JSON value at
 * ["cause"]` for any live `Error` or object holding a bigint or a function,
 * and that encode failure then replaces the failure it was carrying, so the
 * provider 429 or fetch failure that actually happened never reaches the
 * journal.
