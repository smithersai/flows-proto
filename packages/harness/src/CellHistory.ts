 * The source of every cell the current turn executed.

 * just ran into a saved flow needs the script itself back, so this is the one
 * place the run keeps it: the controller appends each cell as it executes, and
 * `flows/show-script` reads the list.

 * nothing and the controller records nothing; {@link layerNoop} states the same
