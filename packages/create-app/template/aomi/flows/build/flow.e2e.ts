/**
 * The build flow against a recorded model.
 *
 * The pipeline is long, so the fixture is what makes it testable at all: the
 * recorded turn replays in milliseconds and the plan it produces is graded
 * field by field. Re-record with `SMTHRS_RECORD=1 pnpm test`, which reads the
 * key for the provider `flows/build/AGENT.ts` names.
 *
 * `routedFlows` supplies the routes so `ui/pane` sees the registered pane list
 * rather than the empty one TOOLS.ts composes. Build renders what it planned,
 * and a run that spends frames being refused by name is not the run the fixture
 * should hold.
