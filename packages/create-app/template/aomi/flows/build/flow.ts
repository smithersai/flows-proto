/**
 * The build flow: a prompt about an app, a plan for building it.
 *
 * This is aomi's smither pipeline as one flow: describe the app, plan the
 * files, generate them, validate, fix what validation found, smoke test, then
 * ship behind an approval. The stages are prompt files in `./prompts`; the
 * agent reads them as it works and reports the whole run as one `BuildPlan`.
 *
 * It is a pipeline flow, not a chat: it runs to completion from its payload and
 * returns a typed plan the Build page renders. `flows/build/AGENT.ts` gives it
 * a stronger seat than the root agent.
