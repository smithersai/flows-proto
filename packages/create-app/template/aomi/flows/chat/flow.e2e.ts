/**
 * The chat flow against a recorded model.
 *
 * `cachedModelTest` replays `./fixtures/balance.json`, so this runs offline and
 * the same model turn is graded on every commit. Re-record against the live
 * seat with `SMTHRS_RECORD=1 pnpm test`; the fixture is written back on a miss.
 * A recording reads the key for the provider the seat names, so the seat in
 * AGENT.ts and the key in the environment have to be the same provider.
 *
 * The card assertion reads the sink, not the output. `cards` in the flow's
 * output is the model reporting what it thinks it emitted, and a model that
 * answered in prose can still name a card there. `routedFlows` binds `ui` to
 * `cards` below, so a `kind: "pane"` entry means `ui/pane` ran and the card
 * registry accepted the pane name.
