/**
 * Installs the process-wide module resolvers required by BUILD.ts evaluation.
 *
 * Targets, the planner, and the flow engine exchange values branded by Effect's
 * runtime symbols. A linked workspace can otherwise load another physical
 * `effect` installation—even at the same version—and hand the engine schemas
 * it cannot interpret. BUILD.ts modules therefore resolve every `effect` bare
 * import from the CLI package that owns the runtime.
 *
 * The CLI also owns the BUILD.ts authoring surface. Resolving
 * `@smthrs/targets` from here lets a globally installed `smthrs` bootstrap a
 * repository that has only a BUILD.ts; requiring the repository to install the
 * package would make generated package.json files circular to create.
 *
 * ## BUILD.ts module format
 *
 * The resolve hook below reports `format: "module"` for every BUILD.ts, so a
 * workspace whose nearest `package.json` declares no `type` still evaluates
 * its BUILD.ts as an ES module — but that override reaches tsx only when
 * these hooks were registered before tsx's loader was created. An evaluation
 * path that misses that window (a bootstrap that touches tsx first, or a
 * nested require from an already-CommonJS module) falls back to tsx's own
 * classification and evaluates BUILD.ts through the CommonJS bridge. There,
 * an `import` of a `file:` URL compiles to `require("file://...")` — valid
 * ESM, but accepted by the CommonJS resolver only on newer Node versions.
 * The `_resolveFilename` patch below converts a `file:` URL request to its
 * path first, so a URL import (for example one produced by
 * `import.meta.resolve`) behaves identically in both formats on every
 * supported Node version.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
