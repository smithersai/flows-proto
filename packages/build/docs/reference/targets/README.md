# Target catalog

Every target in `@smthrs/targets`. Each page lists the target's attributes, its
declared inputs, its success and error channels, and whether it executes today.

Import a target by name from the package root:

```ts
import { Smithers } from "@smthrs/targets"
```

## Execution status

The CLI executor supplies the shared exec, generated-file write/check,
documentation-parity, filegroup, LLM-review,
package-manifest, output-capture, scaffold, and install implementations. It
deliberately does not supply the irreversible-exec implementation, so a target
that publishes externally or applies release versioning fails at interpretation
with an `unresolved_action` refusal.

**Executes** means the target's plan runs through its declared CLI verb, either
as a root or as a dependency. **Plans only** means the target is
planned, queried, and graphed normally, but executing it fails on a missing
action implementation. No catalog target ends in `NotImplemented`; that machinery
exists for future additions and is unused. See
[Running targets](../../workspace/running-targets.md#what-executes).

## Documentation

| Target                       | Kinds  | Cacheable | Status   | Summary                                                |

`PackageJson` uses separate targets for checking and source-tree writes.
`GithubCiGen` maps its `lint` verb to the drift-check form. See [Verb-effective attrs](../../concepts/targets.md#verb-effective-attrs).

## Install, release, and processes

## File sets

| Target                    | Kinds | Cacheable | Status                   | Summary                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Filegroup](filegroup.md) | none  | Always    | Executes as a dependency | Names a set of files under one label, composing transitively. |

A group joins no verb, so it is never selected as a root and never performs work
under `build`, `test`, or `lint`. It is still addressable by label, listed by
`query`, and traversed by `deps(...)`.

## Conventions shared by every tool-running target

- **`cwd`** is the workspace-relative directory the tool starts in. It defaults
  to `"."`, the workspace root. Package-level targets pass their own directory.
  [Dev](dev.md) declares `cwd` without a default, so it is required there.
  [TypedocDocs](typedoc-docs.md), [Changesets](changesets.md),
  [NpmPublish](npm-publish.md), [JsrPublish](jsr-publish.md), and
  [PnpmWorkspace](pnpm-workspace.md) declare no `cwd` at all. `TypedocDocs` and
  `Changesets` run at the workspace root, the publish targets run in the directory
  of their declared manifest, and `PnpmWorkspace` generates its file at the
  workspace root.
- **Tools resolve through `PackageManager.exec`** of the declared package
  manager, so the manager is declared key material rather than a hardcoded
  constant. `ToolBuild`, `Dev`, and the runtime-evaluated helper steps are the
  exceptions.
- **Paths in attrs resolve from `cwd` when the tool runs**, and from the
  declaring package when the planner digests them. A `//`-prefixed path resolves
  from the workspace root in both cases.
- **Success is `Exec.Result`**, `{exitCode, stdout, stderr}`, unless
  the target declares something richer. Producing build targets use `Outputs`.
- **Errors are `Exec.ExecError`**, `{argv, cwd, exitCode, stderr}`, with
  `exitCode: -1` when the spawn itself failed.
