# @smthrs/agent

The flows agent, and the two ways to run it.

`Agent` **is** the agent: one service whose single method runs one whole cell
loop on the durable engine. A **cell** is the JavaScript program the model emits
each frame; it runs in the sandbox, and its only authority is
`ctx.call(flowName, input)`, so every capability a cell reaches is an ordinary
flow settling through a durable boundary. The contract is
[`@smthrs/harness/Cell`](../harness/README.md#the-cell-loop).

`AgentSession` runs that agent as a durable control-plane run — the production
`ControlExecutor`, where the launch is a flow execution, the events go to the
journal, and an operator steers and approves it. `AgentAction` runs that same
agent as one typed step inside a larger flow, bounded by a declared output
schema and replayed like any other action.

Neither adapter reimplements the loop. A future agent that drives a foreign CLI
is another implementation of `Agent.Service`, not a second loop beside this one.

## `Agent`

`Agent.layer` provides the production implementation. It composes the whole cell
path — the controller in `@smthrs/harness/CellTurn`, registry-backed call
resolution in `@smthrs/harness/CellCalls`, the QuickJS sandbox, the durable
engine port in `./FlowEngineLike.ts`, the plugin kernel — and returns the
framework-neutral `Stream<AgentEvent>` the controller emits. There is no
callback, no event emitter, and no host-shaped result type; a caller renders the
stream, journals it, or ignores it.

```ts
import { Agent, ChildFlows, SeatResolver, StandardFlows } from "@smthrs/agent"
import type * as ChildProcessSpawner from "@smthrs/kernel/ChildProcessSpawner"
import type * as Path from "@smthrs/kernel/Path"
import { Effect, Stream } from "effect"
import type * as FileSystem from "effect/FileSystem"

// Inside a flow body — `FlowInstance` is per-execution.
const run = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const agent = yield* Agent.Agent
  // The host's resolver owns the credentials. `agent.run` only ever accepts a
  // seat that came out of one.
  const seats = yield* SeatResolver.SeatResolver
  const seat = yield* seats.resolve("anthropic:claude-opus-5")
  // Each standard flow takes exactly the context its handlers require, so the
  // two capabilities are built from two different slices of the host.
  const filesystemServices = yield* Effect.context<FileSystem.FileSystem | Path.Path>()
  const shellServices = yield* Effect.context<
    ChildProcessSpawner.ChildProcessSpawner | Path.Path
  >()
  return agent.run({
    session,
    seat,
    prompt: task,
    registry,
    // Capabilities are flows. All of them.
    flows: [
      StandardFlows.filesystem(filesystemServices),
      StandardFlows.shell(shellServices),
      ChildFlows.source(children)
    ],
    plugins
  }).pipe(Stream.provide(Agent.layerDefaults))
}).pipe(Effect.provide(Agent.layer))
```

`Seat.make` is documented as the resolved-seat constructor, and a `SeatResolver`
implementation is what calls it. A caller reaches a seat through the resolver,
never by assembling one from a model and a route it happened to hold.

`Agent.layerDefaults` supplies the two services a run leaves to the host —
the QuickJS sandbox and an empty steering source — with browser-safe defaults. A
host that accepts mid-run messages provides its own `Steering.layer` instead.

`Agent.layerDefaultsWithVariant` is the same pair over the QuickJS build the
host names, taken from `QuickJSSandbox.Variant`. A runtime that refuses to
compile WebAssembly from bytes, such as Cloudflare's workerd, uses it and
provides `QuickJSSandbox.layerVariant(variant)` beneath. See
`packages/harness/README.md` for how a worker builds that variant.

`flows` is an ordered list of `FlowBinding.Source`s; plugin `cellFlows` handlers
run after them, in resolution order. The composed catalog is what the model is
shown _and_ what the boundary resolves against, so the declaration digest a cell
was written against is the one checked when the call arrives. Duplicate names
fail composition rather than dispatching one descriptor to another
implementation.

- `StandardFlows` — `filesystem`, `shell`, `memory`, `clock` (a durable wait on
  the engine's `DurableClock`), and `approval` (a narrow injected `Asker` port,
  because a host with nobody to ask should refuse honestly rather than fake an
  answer).
- `ChildFlows` — subagents. An attached child needs nothing here: a dynamic or
  markdown flow called with `ctx.call` already runs inside its own durable
  boundary. Detached lifecycle — `agent/spawn`, `agent/send`, `agent/await` — is
  bound over an injected `Children` port, because nothing browser-safe can
  honestly claim to persist a detached run.
- `CellPlugin.fromBindings` — the one-liner for authoring a harness plugin that
  contributes capabilities.

The provider-tool-call loop is gone. `@smthrs/harness` deleted it along with
every module that existed only to serve it, and nothing replaced it beside the
cell path. A foreign-CLI agent returns as another implementation of
`Agent.Service`, not as a second loop.

## `Seat` and `SeatResolver`

A seat has two halves, and they live in different places on purpose.

The declared half is an ordinary string, and the package ships no schema for
it. It is what a markdown flow's `model:` frontmatter carries and what
`AgentAction`'s `seat` option takes. It carries no credentials, no endpoint, and
no client — a declaration is portable, and a run that reads one out of a
repository must not be handed the keys with it. `provider:modelId`
(`anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5`) is the convention the Node CLI resolver
understands, not a rule the agent enforces.

`Seat.Seat` is the resolved half, and the only thing `Agent.run` accepts: a live
`Model`, the `RouteResolver` that seals its requests, and the model's context
window in tokens so compaction has a real budget. `Seat.make` constructs one,
and a `SeatResolver` implementation is what calls it.

`SeatResolver` is the seam between them, and the credentialed half of the
composition. `@smthrs/cli`'s `NodeControl` installs the resolver that reads keys
from the environment; a test installs one that answers with a scripted model and
never touches the network. `SeatResolver.contextWindowTokensFor` is the catalog
of known models, with a conservative floor — never zero, because zero is
`CellTurn`'s "compaction disabled". A seat the host cannot serve is a typed
`Seat.SeatUnresolved`, not a run that fails halfway through.

Because the resolver owns the seat vocabulary, a host may define its own. A
resolver that maps `reviewer` onto a particular model is an ordinary
implementation of its one method.

## `AgentSession`

`AgentSession.layer(options)` is the production `ControlExecutor` for
`@smthrs/control`: when the control plane accepts a launch, the session looks
the flow up in the registry, loads its markdown prompt body, resolves its
declared seat through `SeatResolver`, and runs the `Agent` service as the body
of one durable flow execution whose id is the control run id.

The composition declares what the spec demands of a host: explicit
`Sandbox.Limits` (never unlimited), a `Steering.Source` over the journal-backed
notification queue `Control.steer` admits into, and an approval `ask` gated in
`authorize` — before the durable boundary opens — that registers an in-run
approval token, parks the run with an encoded `Permission.PermissionRequired`,
and is re-decided against the grant store when `Control.approve` and
`Control.resume` bring the run back.

`@smthrs/cli`'s `NodeControl.layerExecutor` is the Node wiring: a `SeatResolver`
over real `Route.anthropic` / `Route.openai` routes with API keys read from the
environment, and `StandardFlows.filesystem/shell/memory` over the kernel's
guarded host layers.

The module also exports the pieces the session builds itself out of, and they
stay public because a host that runs the agent its own way needs the same ones:
`trace` and `patterns` are the projection half (agent events to durable
`control.agent.*` trail entries, declared capability strings to patterns), and
`waitForRunning`, `waitForParked`, `preserveDriverInterrupt`, `registerDriver`,
and `settleDriverFailure` are the wait and driver-lifecycle half.

## `AgentAction`

`AgentAction.make` declares an ordinary `Action` — same tag, same payload
schema, same `.call()`, same plan node, same durable replay — and ships the
implementation with it. An author never writes `toLayer` for a model call,
because there is only one implementation.

```ts
import { AgentAction } from "@smthrs/agent"
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"

const Research = AgentAction.make("docs/Research", {
  payload: { topic: Schema.String },
  output: Schema.Struct({ summary: Schema.String }),
  seat: "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5",
  system: ["You are a research assistant."],
  prompt: ({ topic }) => `Research ${topic}.`
})
```

The declared output schema is rendered into the run's system teaching and
enforced against the run's final answer; a decode miss spends a correction slot
on a re-prompt before it becomes a typed `StructuredOutputFailure`. The host
half is `AgentAction.Host` — the registry, the sandbox budget, and the catalog
every model-backed action in a composition shares — plus `SeatResolver` and
`Agent`. A test swaps the whole model for a scripted one by providing a
different `SeatResolver`.

### Composing it

Every layer a model-backed step needs, trimmed from
`examples/src/11-agent-step.ts`. `AgentAction.make` returns the declaration and
its `.layer` together, so the composition names the action once.

```ts
import * as NodeCrypto from "@effect/platform-node/NodeCrypto"
import { Agent, AgentAction, Seat, SeatResolver } from "@smthrs/agent"
import { FlowEngine } from "@smthrs/engine"
import { Action, Interpreter } from "@smthrs/flow"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"

const layer = Layer.mergeAll(
  Research.layer,
  Interpreter.layer(SimpleWorkflow)
).pipe(
  // The registry, the sandbox budget, and the catalog every model-backed
  // action shares, plus the credentialed seam and the agent itself.
  Layer.provideMerge(Layer.mergeAll(
    AgentAction.layerHost({ registry, limits: { calls: 8 }, capabilityEnvelope: [], maxFrames: 4 }),
    SeatResolver.layer({
      resolve: (id) => Effect.succeed(Seat.make({ id, model, route, contextWindowTokens: 200_000 }))
    }),
    Agent.layer
  )),
  // The QuickJS sandbox a cell runs in and the steering source it drains.
  Layer.provideMerge(Agent.layerDefaults),
  // Ordinary flow composition: action implementations, a durable engine, crypto.
  Layer.provideMerge(Action.layerImplementations),
  Layer.provideMerge(FlowEngine.layerMemory),
  Layer.provideMerge(NodeCrypto.layer)
)
```

## The engine port

`@smthrs/harness` owns the _port_ — `sealStep`, `call`, `splice`, `record`,
`suspend` — and ships only `EngineLike.layer(implementation)` and
`EngineLike.layerNoop()`. It deliberately does not depend on any engine: the
browser app supplies its own in-tab implementation, and pulling the durable
engine into the port package would put it in every harness consumer's bundle.
`FlowEngineLike` is the other implementation, kept separate for the same reason
`platform-node` is separate from the platform contracts in the effect repo.

```ts
import { FlowEngineLike } from "@smthrs/agent"
import { Effect } from "effect"

// Inside a flow body — `FlowInstance` is per-execution.
const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const engine = yield* FlowEngineLike.make({
    model,
    route: FlowEngineLike.routeResolver(anthropic),
    calls: { authorize: (call) => checkGrants(call), run: (call) => runFlow(call) }
  })
  // ...provide `engine` to the harness.
})
```

## What durability buys

- **`sealStep`** resolves the route, runs `Route.prepare`, and digests the
  credential-free prepared request together with the harness's declared key
  material into a `StepKey`. That key is the sealed activity's idempotency key:
  a replayed turn re-emits the recorded model events instead of calling the
  provider again, and a provider wire change produces a new key. Credentials
  are signed on after the digest and never enter it.
- **`call`** runs one flow call from inside a running cell as its own activity
  at the tier the flow declares. A sealed call is content-addressed on its
  declaration digest, resolved layers, declared capabilities, and arguments, so
  it replays wherever it appears; anything else folds in the whole cell
  identity — session, frame, cell digest, and the call's execution ordinal — so
  two invocations stay distinct, an irreversible effect is run-scoped, and a
  cell re-executed after a park replays exactly the boundaries that already
  settled. Authorization is checked _before_ the activity opens: an activity's
  outcome is journaled, so a permission requirement raised from inside one
  would replay forever and no later grant could unblock it.
- **`splice`** runs each elaborated child as its own activity at the tier the
  child declares. A sealed child is content-addressed and replays; a
  compensable or irreversible child folds the run scope — the flow and
  execution the port was built inside — and the model's `callId` into its key,
  so two invocations of one declaration stay distinct steps and two runs that
  both labelled a call `call-1` cannot alias onto one another. That is also
  what lets the engine retry an irreversible activity at all.
- **Composition identity.** `Options.layers` is the resolved layer stack and
  plugin list the host actually built, and it is folded into every key this
  port derives. A boundary resolved under a different composition is a
  different boundary, so a plugin swap can never be served a recorded result
  from the composition it replaced. The port also declares that layer set as
  the engine's content environment (`Activity.CurrentContentEnvironment`).
- **Authority identity.** The other half of the content environment is
  `Options.capabilities`, and the port never invents it. A sealed boundary is
  cross-run cacheable, so a result computed under a broad capability envelope
  must not be served to a run with an attenuated one, even when the call
  declares identical capabilities — the envelope is what attenuates it
  (issue #75). Supplying the composition's **complete** authority is what
  makes a sealed boundary shareable across runs; omitting it is the honest
  "unknown", and the engine answers it by pinning every sealed key to the
  current execution. `Agent.run` declares the capability envelope it actually
  built, so hosts on that path get cross-run reuse without asserting anything
  false.
- **`record`** journals one nondeterministic controller read — the
  turn-boundary steering drain — as its own run-scoped boundary. A resumed
  run replays the recorded drain instead of reading an already-drained queue,
  which is what keeps a resume on the original attempt's sealed steps.
- **`suspend`** is a real durable suspension (`Flow.suspend`). The execution
  parks and the engine can resume it, rather than the port failing.

## Not to be confused with

`@smthrs/testing`'s `FlowEngineLike` adapts the same engine to a different
port — `EngineSubject` (`run` / `result` / `interrupt` / `resume` / `journal`),
the testing library's conformance contract. The two share a backing engine and
nothing else.
