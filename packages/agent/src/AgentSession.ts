/**
 * One control-plane launch, run as one durable agent session.
 *
 * This is the production `ControlExecutor`. `ControlLive.run` resolves the
 * executor through `Effect.serviceOption`, and until this module existed
 * nothing provided one, so every accepted run stayed `pending` forever. What it
 * does is take a stored plan, find the flow's descriptor and prompt body in the
 * registry, resolve the flow's declared seat through {@link SeatResolver}, and
 * run {@link module:Agent} as the body of one durable flow execution whose id
 * is the control run id.
 *
 * The session is the adapter, not the agent. Everything about how a frame is
 * built, sealed, and replayed belongs to `Agent`; what belongs here is the
 * control-plane half — status fencing, the resume bridge, the approval gate,
 * and the journal trail.
 *
 * What the composition declares, because the spec says a host must:
 *
 * - **Explicit sandbox limits.** `Options.limits` is required; an unlimited
 *   QuickJS cell can hang the frame, so there is no default-unlimited path.
 * - **A resolved context window.** `Seat.contextWindowTokens` comes back from
 *   the host's `SeatResolver`, so compaction is armed instead of silently
 *   disabled at zero. `SeatResolver.contextWindowTokensFor` is the catalog for
 *   known models.
 * - **Steering from the durable queue.** The `Steering.Source` is
 *   `@smthrs/harness/Notifications` over the same journal-backed queue
 *   `Control.steer` admits into, so an operator steer reaches the loop at the
 *   next frame boundary.
 * - **Approval through control.** The `ask` flow is gated in the `authorize`
 *   hook — before the durable boundary opens — by registering an in-run
 *   approval token (`ControlRuntime.registerApproval`) and failing with an
 *   encoded `Permission.PermissionRequired`, which the controller turns into
 *   a real durable park. `Control.approve` resolves the token and installs
 *   the grant; the resumed attempt re-asks against the grant store as it now
 *   stands and proceeds. The park is decided outside the activity on purpose:
 *   a requirement raised inside one would be journaled and replayed forever.
 *
 * Run-status writes stay fenced: the executor waits for the control plane's
 * own `running` transition before the engine starts, writes
 * `waiting-approval` when the execution parks, and writes the terminal status
 * when it settles. Resumption is event-driven — the executor follows the
 * journal for the control plane's resume events and re-drives the parked
 * engine execution.
 *
 * Reference consulted: `reference/effect` `unstable/workflow` by way of
 * `@smthrs/engine`'s `FlowRuntime` (register/execute/poll/resume), and
 * `reference/opencode` `packages/core/src/session` for the shape of a
 * background run driver owned by a scope.
