/**
 * The built-in host capabilities, expressed as ordinary executable flows.
 *
 * There is no `ctx.fs`, no `ctx.shell`, no `ctx.memory`, and no `ctx.wait`. A
 * cell that reads a file and a cell that calls a remote MCP tool run the same
 * two lines — look the flow up in `ctx.flows`, invoke it with `ctx.call` — and
 * both boundaries are the same keyed, journaled, permission-gated activity.
 * This module is what makes that true for the standard capabilities: each
 * helper pairs a declaration that already exists (`@smthrs/std`,
 * `@smthrs/memory/Flows`) with the handler that already exists, through the
 * one binding contract in `@smthrs/harness/FlowBinding`.
 *
 * Each helper takes the `Context` the host built, because a handler's
 * requirements are the host's to supply — a browser host provides a different
 * `FileSystem` than a Node host, and neither of them changes what the cell
 * sees.
 *
 * Two capabilities cannot be written generically, and both take a narrow
 * injected port rather than a fake:
 *
 * - {@link approval} needs a human. The port is one `ask`. A host with nobody to
 *   ask refuses with {@link ApprovalUnavailable}, which the cell may catch; a
 *   host that wants the run to *wait* fails with a `HarnessError` carrying a
 *   `Permission.PermissionRequired`, or gates the call in
 *   `Agent.Options.authorize` — either way the park stays in the typed error
 *   channel where the cell can neither see nor swallow it.
 * - {@link clock} needs the durable engine, so it is the one helper here whose
 *   context is `FlowEngine`. It is not part of the browser-safe core, and
 *   nothing in `Agent` imports it. A durable sleep past the in-memory
 *   threshold awaits a `DurableDeferred`, whose key is hashed, so the host
 *   supplies `Crypto` alongside the runtime — the same three services
 *   `FlowEngineLike.make` captures from the flow it is built inside.
