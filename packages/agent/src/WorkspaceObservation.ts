/**
 * Measuring the workspace a run is changing, so the loop's mutation
 * accounting is a fact rather than a claim.
 *
 * `@smthrs/harness` declares the port
 * (`EngineLike.observe`) and states why it exists. This module is the
 * production answer to it: a pruned walk of the workspace root that reads a
 * cheap identity off every file it keeps and folds the lot into one digest.
 * Two measurements taken around a frame answer "did this frame change the
 * tree", which is the question `bash` makes unanswerable from declarations —
 * a spawned process writes wherever it likes and tells nobody.
 *
 * Three properties are the design:
 *
 * - **Identity, not content.** Each kept file contributes its path, its size,
 *   and its modification time. Reading every byte would be the stronger
 *   measurement and it costs the whole tree twice per frame; size and mtime
 *   move for every write a shell command can perform, including the redirect
 *   that started this. A rewrite that restores the byte count *and* the
 *   timestamp is invisible here, and that is the stated limit.
 * - **Pruning is the signal.** An unpruned walk reports a mutation every time
 *   the run executes anything: `pytest` writes `__pycache__`, a build writes
 *   `.so` files beside their sources, `git` rewrites its own index. Those are
 *   derived artifacts, not the work a run is judged on, and counting them
 *   would keep the read-only cap permanently satisfied — the same blindness
 *   the measurement exists to remove, inverted. {@link defaultPrune} and
 *   {@link defaultIgnoreSuffixes} name what is skipped and both are
 *   injectable, so a host whose derived artifacts differ declares its own.
 * - **A vanished path is not an error.** Paths are listed and then measured,
 *   and a background process the run spawned can remove one in between. Such a
 *   path is left out of the measurement rather than failing it: the tree moved,
 *   and the next measurement will say so.
 * - **A partial walk says so.** The walk stops at {@link Options.maxPaths}, and
 *   a measurement that stopped there covers a prefix. It reports
 *   `complete: false`, and the controller then decides changed-ness from what
 *   the frame's calls declared rather than from a prefix that may never have
 *   looked at the files being edited.
