/**
 * The production `EngineLike` binding: the harness engine port executed on the
 * durable flow engine from `@smthrs/engine`.
 *
 * `@smthrs/harness` declares the port (`sealStep` / `splice` / `suspend`) and
 * ships only `layer(implementation)` and `layerNoop`. This module supplies the
 * missing implementation, so a production consumer can run the harness on the
 * durable engine without reaching into `@smthrs/testing`.
 *
 * The binding is deliberately *not* `@smthrs/testing`'s `FlowEngineLike`:
 * that module adapts the engine to `EngineSubject`
 * (`run` / `result` / `interrupt` / `resume` / `journal`), the conformance
 * contract used by the testing library. The two ports share a backing engine
 * and nothing else, and `packages/testing/test/EngineSubject.test.ts` asserts
 * they stay distinct.
 *
 * How the port maps onto the engine:
 *
 * - `sealStep` resolves the route, runs `Route.prepare`, and digests the
 *   credential-free `PreparedRequest` — canonical body bytes included —
 *   together with the harness's declared key material into a `StepKey`
 *   (`docs/specs/Concepts/Step Keys.md`). That key is the *sealed* activity's
 *   idempotency key, so a provider wire change produces a new key and a
 *   replayed turn re-emits the recorded model events without calling the
 *   provider again. Credentials are signed on by the route after the digest
 *   and never enter it.
 * - `splice` runs each elaborated child as its own activity at the tier the
 *   child declares. Sealed children take a pure content key, so the same
 *   sealed call replays one recorded result; compensable and irreversible
 *   children fold the run scope *and* the model's `callId` into the key, which
 *   keeps two invocations of one declaration distinct, keeps two runs that both
 *   labelled a call `call_1` from aliasing onto one another, and satisfies the
 *   engine's requirement that an irreversible activity declare an idempotency
 *   key before it may be retried.
 * - `record` journals one nondeterministic controller read — the steering
 *   drain, and the workspace measurements below — as its own run-scoped
 *   boundary, so a resumed run replays the recorded value instead of reading
 *   the world a second time.
 * - `observe` measures the workspace through `WorkspaceObservation.Observer`
 *   when the composition provides one, and reports it unobserved when it does
 *   not. This is what lets the controller decide "did this frame change
 *   anything" from the tree rather than from what the frame's calls declared —
 *   a shell command declares nothing and writes wherever it likes.
 * - Every key folds in the resolved composition identity `Options.layers` — the
 *   host's layer stack and its resolved plugin list. A boundary resolved under a
 *   different composition is a different boundary.
 * - `suspend` is a real durable suspension (`Flow.suspend`), not a failure.
 *   The execution parks and can be resumed by the engine.
 *
 * Reference consulted: `reference/effect` `unstable/workflow` (Action /
 * Workflow / DurableDeferred) by way of the vendored fork in
 * `@smthrs/engine`, and `reference/temporal`'s activity-identity rules for
 * why a non-sealed invocation must carry a distinguishing key.

/**
 * Retries transient provider failures inside the sealed step.
 *
 * The retry is deliberately here rather than on the action's `retryPolicy`.
 * The engine's policy classifies by error *tag*, and every provider failure
 * shares the one `flows/model/ModelError` tag, so a tag-level policy either
 * retries a bad API key four times or retries nothing. It also replaces an
 * exhausted failure with `RetryAttemptsExhausted`, which would hide the very
 * `code` the caller branches on. Retrying in place keeps the classification
 * precise and lets the original typed error surface unchanged when the
 * backoff gives up.
 *
 * Each retry states the delay the schedule chose for it. The delay cannot be
 * read back off the journal timestamps: every retry of one step is buffered
 * and written when the step settles, so a run that backed off for half a
 * minute and one that did not back off at all are indistinguishable there.
 *
 * The classification is a `Schedule.while` *inside* the schedule rather than
 * `Effect.retry`'s `while` option, and the tap sits outside it. Both placements
 * matter. `Effect.retry` applies its `while` after stepping the schedule, so a
 * tap under it fires once for a terminal failure too and records a retry that
 * never happened — a `quota_exceeded` run journaled a phantom `model-retried`
 * exactly that way. Stopping the schedule first means the tap only ever sees a
 * step that will really recur, and `duration` is then the delay actually
 * slept — jitter and bound already applied — not the nominal one the base
 * schedule would have produced.
 *
 * `budgetMillis` is the same retry, applied to the one failure the provider
 * never reports: a call that answers, slowly, forever. It is enforced here
 * rather than around the whole sealed step so an overrun is an attempt rather
 * than the end of the frame — it is interrupted, classified `call_timeout`,
 * and re-issued on this schedule with {@link overrunTeaching} in front of it.
 * Interruption is the only mechanism involved: `Effect.timeoutOrElse` closes
 * the attempt's scope, and the model layer's own request teardown follows from
 * that, so nothing threads an abort signal and nothing polls a flag.
 *
 * The overrun rides the schedule's delays but not its count. Every other
 * retryable code fails fast and costs a backoff; an overrun costs a whole
 * armed ceiling, so it stops after {@link defaultModelOverruns} re-issues and
 * the step's total model time stays bounded by twice the budget rather than by
 * six times it.
