/**
 * A durable wait taken from inside an action, on the flow's own instance.
 *
 * `wrapActionResult` counts the action regions open on one instance, and a
 * suspension waits for that count to fall before it lets the flow park: a
 * sibling action still in flight holds work the journal has not recorded yet,
 * and suspending out from under it would lose that work.
 *
 * An *enclosing* region is not a sibling. It cannot settle until the region
 * inside it returns, so waiting for it to settle is waiting for the caller to
 * finish waiting. That is the shape every harness cell call has — each
 * `ctx.call` is an action, and the `wait` flow it dispatches awaits a durable
 * clock under the run's own instance — and it is what two `r96repl` SWE-bench
 * runs died of: `clock-scheduled`, a fired clock, one
 * `{"decision":"wake-scheduled","reason":"clock"}`, and then nothing at all,
 * with the run row still `running` and carrying no waiting reason, because the
 * round that should have parked never ended.
 *
 * The wait ran inside an `Effect.onExit` finalizer, so the block was
 * uninterruptible: no timeout, no cancellation and no operator resume could
 * reach it. Each case here therefore settles its round on a fiber of its own
 * and reports "never settled" rather than hanging the suite.
