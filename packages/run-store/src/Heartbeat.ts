 * write failures for exactly that long would still be executing side effects
 * when the steal is admitted. The budget is therefore
 * {@link heartbeatStaleAfter} minus {@link heartbeatSkewAllowance} (the peer's
 * clock may already read that much later than the owner's) minus one
 * {@link heartbeatInterval} (the owner only re-evaluates the budget once per
 * pulse, so it may notice the expiry a full tick late).
 *
 * This bounds, but does not eliminate, overlap. Beyond
 * {@link heartbeatSkewAllowance} of clock offset a peer can be admitted while
 * the old owner is still running. *Durable* writes stay safe regardless — they
 * are fenced by the ownership compare-and-set, so the displaced owner's writes
 * fail rather than corrupt. Non-durable external side effects (an HTTP call, a
 * spawned process) can genuinely overlap. That is inherent to any wall-clock
 * lease and is stated here rather than asserted away; a caller that cannot
 * tolerate any overlap needs an external fencing token at the side effect
 * itself, not a larger timeout.
