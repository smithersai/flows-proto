# @smthrs/targets

`@smthrs/targets` defines the pure authoring surface used by `BUILD.ts` files.
Target calls perform no filesystem reads and start no processes. They return
Flow declarations with planner metadata attached.

The package exports one named namespace, `Smithers`, the way `effect` exports
`Effect`. A `BUILD.ts` file imports it once and reaches the whole catalog
through it, so the import line never changes as a workspace grows. Library code
that consumes this package imports the module it needs directly instead, as
`@smthrs/targets/Target`.

Every catalog target is implemented. Only the `Target.ts` stub machinery remains,
for future catalog additions.

A workspace declares its toolchain once and passes it to everything that runs a
tool. `Smithers.Runtime.Node` and `.Bun` declare a runtime;
`Smithers.PackageManager.Pnpm` and `.BunPackages` declare a package manager
over one. `Runtime` and `PackageManager` are each both the
namespace their constructors live under and the type those constructors return.
Every tool-running target takes the manager as a required attr and asks
`Smithers.PackageManager.exec` for its argv, so nothing in the catalog spells
`pnpm` or `node` into an argv of its own and switching either is one edit to the
root `BUILD.ts` file.

```ts
import { Smithers } from "@smthrs/targets"

export const runtime: Smithers.Runtime = Smithers.Runtime.Node({ version: ">=22.19.0" })
export const packageManager = Smithers.PackageManager.Pnpm({ version: "11.21.0", runtime })
export const nodeModules = Smithers.Install({ packageManager })
```

`Smithers.Secret("NAME")` declares a credential without reading it. The value is
resolved lazily, at execution, and only for a target that declared the secret;
what reaches a child process is an unguessable placeholder that the
substituting proxy replaces on outbound requests. Key material records the
variable name, never the value.

`Smithers.Workspace` is the workspace configuration declaration the root
`BUILD.ts` file exports. It validates and performs
no I/O. `cacheDirectory` defaults to `.flows` and must name a single
workspace-relative directory; `gitignored` defaults to false. The CLI resolves
the declaration against `--cache-dir` and passes the result explicitly to
`Input` glob expansion. `DepsLint` uses a constant plan-time token that the
exec layer replaces with the resolved directory immediately before spawn. The
resolved directory is host state and never reaches target attrs, a cache key, or
a content digest.

`Smithers.RemoteCache.make({ endpoint, token })` is the matching inert declaration for
the HTTP result cache. The endpoint must use HTTPS. `token` is a `Secret`
declaration and defaults to `Smithers.Secret("SMITHERS_CACHE_TOKEN")`; the bearer token
value is never a declaration field or key input.

## Rust and Cargo

A Cargo workspace has no Node runtime, no package manager, and no installed
modules tree. `Smithers.Workspace` therefore takes a `toolchains` layer list,
and the JavaScript trio is required only for a workspace that declares no
layer. `Smithers.Rust.Toolchain` is that layer, in the two forms design
partners actually pin with:

```ts
// A repository whose CI pins the channel by hand.
const rust = S.Rust.Toolchain({ workspace: S.file("//Cargo.toml"), channel: "1.91" })

// A repository with a checked-in pin file, and a committed lockfile.
const pinned = S.Rust.Toolchain({
  toolchain: S.file("//rust-toolchain.toml"),
  lockfile: S.file("//Cargo.lock")
})

export const Workspace = S.Workspace("aomi-sdk", {
  repository: "git+https://github.com/aomi-labs/aomi-sdk.git",
  cache: S.Cache({ directory: ".flows" }),
  toolchains: [rust],
  host: S.Host({ bins: ["cargo"] })
})
```

The declared channel is selected, not hoped for: every cargo run carries it as
`RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`, so a host without the pin fails at the start of the run
naming the channel instead of mid-compile on a rustc the crates refuse.

`Smithers.Cargo` holds the package-mode rules. Each names its crates with
exactly one selector — `workspace: true`, `package: "<name>"`, or
`crates: <set>`:

```ts
const fetch = S.Cargo.Fetch({
  workspace: S.file("//Cargo.toml"),
  outFiles: ["//Cargo.lock"],
  outDirs: ["//.cargo-home"],
  sandbox: { network: true }
})

const clippy = S.Cargo.Clippy({
  workspace: true,
  lib: true,
  denyWarnings: true,
  locked: true,
  offline: true,
  data: [srcs, fetch]
})
```

`Cargo.Fetch` is the one network-enabled cargo target: the lockfile and the
vendored registry are its declared deliverables, its first `outDirs` entry
becomes the `CARGO_HOME` every dependent reads, and a dependent keys on the
lockfile content it delivered rather than on the fetch declaration. That is the
`node_modules` rule applied to Cargo: a dynamic install and static dependents
that run `--locked --offline` against what it produced. A fetch may name a
crate set instead of one manifest (`S.Cargo.Fetch({ crates })`), which is what
a repository whose crates are excluded from the root workspace needs: each of
those crates is its own lockfile domain, and one workspace manifest cannot
deliver what they resolve against.

`offline: true` reaches the child processes a cargo run spawns, not only the
run itself: the `--offline` flag speaks for one cargo, and a test that shells
out to a nested cargo — trybuild's compile-fail suites are the common case —
would otherwise reach for the registry and fail against the sandbox. The
planner sets `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE` alongside the flag so the declaration's
statement holds all the way down.

`Cargo.Fmt` checks by default and applies under `--write`/`--fix`, confined to
its declared `changes` write set. It is the one cargo rule with no
`locked`/`offline` attrs, because rustfmt never resolves a dependency.

`Cargo.AppSet` is a crate set computed from manifest globs and filtered by
`[package.metadata]`. It is a value, not a run, and `Smithers.Files.difference`
subtracts one set from another exactly as it does for file sets:

```ts
const allApps = S.Cargo.AppSet({ manifests: S.glob(["*/Cargo.toml"]) })
const skipped = S.Cargo.AppSet({ manifests: S.glob(["*/Cargo.toml"]), metadata: { aomi: { skip: true } } })
const compile = S.Cargo.Build({ crates: S.Files.difference(allApps, skipped), lib: true, locked: true })
```

The planner expands the set at plan time, keys the consuming target on the
manifests it found and their contents, and renders one cargo command per
selected crate.

`Cargo.Fmt`, `Cargo.Clippy`, and `Cargo.Test` are also the BUILD-era check
constructors the legacy `Smithers.CargoLint` and `Smithers.CargoTest` targets
take as an attr. The crate selector tells the two apart: every package-mode
declaration names one and no BUILD-era call ever passes one, so
`Smithers.Cargo.Clippy()` is still a check value and
`Smithers.Cargo.Clippy({ workspace: true })` is a target. A repository moving
from `BUILD.ts` to `PACKAGE.ts` does not rename its cargo gates.

A build target may be a tool edge. `S.Shell.Build({ bin: sdk.buildCli })` and
`S.Generate({ bin: sdk.buildCli })` spawn the one binary that build declares
(`bins: ["aomi-build"]` under the default profile is `target/debug/aomi-build`),
and the build becomes an ordinary dependency, so the generator is built before
its consumer runs and the generator's identity keys everything it produced.
