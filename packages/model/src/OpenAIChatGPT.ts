/**
 * Route construction for OpenAI's ChatGPT-subscription Responses backend, the
 * deployment the codex CLI speaks. The wire protocol is
 * {@link OpenAIResponses.chatgptProtocol}: the same SSE stream as
 * api.openai.com with the request narrowed to the subscription surface.
 *
 * The credential is an OAuth access token plus a `chatgpt-account-id` header,
 * both rotating, so the route takes a composed {@link Auth.Auth} rather than a
 * redacted key: the host owns the token store and its refresh, and this module
 * owns everything deterministic — endpoint, protocol, and the static header
 * set the backend was confirmed against (2026-08-25).
