// Three kinds of package are NOT re-exported and so are excluded here: the
// barrel itself (`flows`), the `platform-*` bundles, and packages outside the
// engine group. A platform bundle is chosen by the program that runs, not by
// the library it depends on — the same reason `effect`'s index does not
// re-export `@effect/platform-node` — and re-exporting all three would make one
// import resolve `node:child_process`, ZenFS, and Bun at once.
//
// The agent group is a separate release surface built on the engine; this
// barrel gathers the durable engine only. The tooling group is excluded for
// the same class of reason, decided in review when smithers build was absorbed into
// this repo (2026-08-15). It is the BUILD.ts build system — `@smthrs/build`
// (install/package-manager actions), `@smthrs/targets` (BUILD.ts rules), and
// `@smthrs/build-cli` (the `smthrs` binary) — not part of the durable flow engine
// surface this barrel exists to gather.
// Re-exporting them would also break two invariants the barrel holds today:
// `@smthrs/targets` and `@smthrs/build-cli` are `private: true` and never published, so
// the published `@smthrs/flows` would depend on packages no consumer can
// resolve; and `@smthrs/build-cli` pulls `@effect/platform-node`, which would drag
// `node:child_process` into the barrel that `pnpm browser` asserts is
// browser-safe. Reach them through their own packages.
