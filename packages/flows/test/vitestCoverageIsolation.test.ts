/**
 * Every package's coverage thresholds are its primary regression gate, so the
 * gate itself has to be deterministic. The v8 coverage provider clears its
 * `.tmp` scratch directory at run start and reads it at run end; with the
 * default `./coverage` report directory two concurrent `vitest run`
 * invocations in the same package destroy each other — one aborts with a
 * removed-coverage-directory error and the other enforces 100% against a
 * partial profile with every test passing (issues #115/#121). #115's fix
 * landed in one package only; this conformance test pins the per-process,
 * tmpdir-scoped `reportsDirectory` derivation across ALL packages so a new or
 * regressed config cannot reintroduce the collision.
 *
 * The assertion is on config source text: importing each sibling package's
 * `vitest.config.ts` cross-package would drag in each package's own tsconfig
 * and resolution context, so the deterministic source-level contract is the
 * pinned shape instead — a `reportsDirectory` built from `tmpdir()` and
 * `process.pid`.
