/**
 * Pins issue #96: the durable-state range read and the `AttemptStore`

 * shape of pruned prefix. Before the fix the SQL path reported a survivor
 * whatever its attempt number while the fallback gave up after 32 missing
 * leading attempts, so the same run restored its retry origin under SQL
 * state and silently restarted its expiration budget under the fallback.
