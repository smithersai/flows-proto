/**
 * Pins issues #80 and #81: the run-parent edge table can never hold ghost
 * edges.
 *
 * #80 — `ensureRun` committed the parent edge in its own transaction before
 * `store.create`; a crash in the window left a durable edge for a child run
 * that never existed, unswept forever and able to force a false
 * `FlowCycleDetected` when the execution id was reused under an inverted
 * topology. Edge record and run-row creation now share one storage
 * transaction: either both commit or neither.
 *
 * #81 — the "call `removeRunParentsForRun` when deleting run rows" contract
 * was comment-only with zero production callers. An AFTER DELETE trigger on
 * `flows_runs` now prunes a deleted run's edges at the database level, so a
 * future retention/GC lane cannot silently leave ghosts in the cycle walk.
