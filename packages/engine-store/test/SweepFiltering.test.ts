/**
 * Pins issue #68: the parked-run sweep used to do an unfiltered
 * `waitingRuns()` scan plus one `store.get` per parked row, every heartbeat,
 * in every driver — linear in total parked runs even though it acts only on
 * released or cancel-requested rows. The sweep must fetch only actionable
 * rows through the `WaitingRunsFilter` (reason `released`, and the
 * cancel-requested predicate added for this issue), so a quota/event-parked
 * fleet costs the sweeper nothing per tick.
 *
 * Uses the SQL `DurableEngineState` over the same database as `RunStore`:
 * the filter's cancel predicate reads `flows_runs.cancel_requested_at_ms`.
