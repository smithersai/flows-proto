     * Carries a parent's durable cancellation onto a child that was linked
     * AFTER the parent's cascade had already run.
     *
     * Admission and cancellation are two separate serialized write
     * transactions over the same store, so they interleave in both orders and
     * neither order may leak a live child (issue #83):
     *
     * - Admission first. The edge is committed before the cancellation
     *   transaction opens, so `requestCancelDescendants` sees the child and
     *   requests it. Nothing more is needed here.
     * - Cancellation first. The cascade walked `flows_run_parents` while the
     *   edge did not exist yet, so it could not have seen this child — and
     *   the parent's drive may already be gone, so nothing will walk the
     *   edge table again on its behalf. The child would be created fresh and
     *   uncancelled, and would run to completion under a cancelled parent.
     *
     * The second order is closed by reading the parent row inside the SAME
     * outer storage transaction that recorded the edge and created the child
     * row, after the child row exists. Either the cancellation transaction
     * committed before this read, in which case the request is visible here
     * and is inherited atomically with the child's own creation, or it has
     * not committed yet, in which case it commits after this transaction and
     * its own cascade sees the edge. There is no third interleaving, so no
     * ephemeral hand-off flag and no timing-based retry is involved. The
     * argument rests on two things: the store's serialized writes, and the
     * order inside `requestCancelDescendants` — a cancellation marks its own
     * run before it walks the edge table, which is what keeps the two sides
     * from missing each other even where `DurableEngineState.transaction` is
     * the in-memory pass-through and only the run-row writes serialize.
     *
     * Nesting falls out of this: the inherited request is written to the
     * child's own row, so a grandchild admitted later reads a cancel-requested
     * parent and inherits in turn.
     *
     * `requestCancel` is unfenced and first-writer-wins, so a repeated
     * admission writes nothing the second time; a parent row that is gone
     * answers `NotFound` and inherits nothing. Only a cancelled parent is
     * inherited from — `cancel_requested_at_ms`, or a parent already settled
     * terminally `cancelled` whose request column a compaction could have
     * cleared — so an ordinary `completed` or `failed` parent never cancels
     * a child.
     *
     * The child does not need its own cascade here: it was just created, so
     * it has no descendants of its own, and once it observes the inherited
     * request `cancelOwned` cascades from it like any other cancellation.
