/**
 * The ownership fence under a real takeover, across two real connections to one
 * file-backed SQLite database.
 *
 * `JournalFence.test.ts` proves the `WHERE EXISTS` predicate against a
 * hand-made in-memory `flows_runs` fixture with a single connection, where
 * ownership never changes *while* an append is in flight. That is the case the
 * fence exists for: a zombie owner already inside its write path when a
 * successor takes the run. This suite opens that window deterministically —
 * the stale writer parks on the threshold of its write transaction, the
 * successor commits the ownership change and its own entry on a second
 * connection, and the stale writer is then released into a database that has
 * moved on.
 *
 * `flows_runs` belongs to `@smthrs/run-store`, which depends on this
 * package, so the columns the fence reads are stood up here as a fixture — the
 * same contract `JournalFence.test.ts` asserts.
 *
 * Prior art: Temporal's shard `rangeID` fencing
 * (`reference/temporal/service/history/shard/context_impl.go`,
 * `renewRangeLocked`), reduced to one SQL predicate.
