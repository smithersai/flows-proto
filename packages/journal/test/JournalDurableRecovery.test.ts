/**
 * Crash-shaped append recovery against a real file-backed SQLite database.
 *
 * `JournalCompaction.test.ts` injects a crash into an in-memory database during
 * compaction; `JournalDurable.test.ts` restarts cleanly. Neither covers the
 * append path losing its process between the INSERT and the COMMIT, which is
 * the case a durable journal exists for: the row must be absent, the producer
 * identity must be free, and the next allocation must continue from the durable
 * floor rather than from the sequence the dead writer had already claimed.
 *
 * The crash is injected at the SQL layer, over a real file. That is the same
 * idiom `JournalCompaction.test.ts` uses, lifted onto a real database because
 * an in-memory one cannot outlive the connection that would have crashed.
 * Child processes are not available to this package's tooling, so "reopen in a
 * fresh process" is a fresh `NodeDatabase` connection to the same file, which
 * is what actually re-reads the durable floor.
 *
 * Prior art: Temporal, whose readers of damaged history fail with a typed
 * `DataLoss` rather than replaying a prefix
 * (`reference/temporal/common/persistence/history_manager.go`).
