/**
 * The cache store against a real file-backed SQLite database, with two real
 * connections.
 *
 * `CacheStore.test.ts` drives first-writer-wins through one in-memory
 * connection, which cannot show what the contract is for: the window is a
 * *second connection* recording under the same digest at the same time. These
 * cases open two connections on one tmpdir file, align them on a latch, and
 * assert the durable outcome — the same shape `JournalDurable.test.ts` uses for
 * the journal's allocation contract.
 *
 * Child processes are not available to this package's tooling, so "two writers"
 * is two independent `NodeDatabase` connections in one process. That is the
 * boundary the SQLite locking protocol actually arbitrates; the process
 * boundary above it adds no further serialization.
