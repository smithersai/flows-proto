/*
 * CN-24 — rollback readiness, probed against the real Cloudflare account.
 *
 *   bun scripts/canary/rollback-probe.ts [--receipt <path>]
 *
 * Asserts three things about smithers-mvp-web:
 *
 *   1. the newest deploy receipt names a wrangler version id,
 *   2. that version is the one Cloudflare is actually serving,
 *   3. a prior version is still in Cloudflare's version list, so
 *      `wrangler rollback <id>` has something to target.
 *
 * "Reachable" means rollback-ELIGIBLE, not fetchable. A prior Worker version
 * has no URL of its own; nothing can HTTP it. The probe says exactly what it
 * checked and never implies more.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT automated: performing the rollback and rolling forward
 * again. That swaps the live deployment, so it belongs in a human drill —
 * DEPLOY.md carries the procedure and the receipt it must leave behind.
 *
 * Where it runs: deploy receipts are gitignored and exist only on the machine
 * that deployed, so this belongs in the deploy workflow after a real deploy,
 * not in a scheduled canary that has no receipt to read.
 *
 * Environment:
 *   CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN   required; unset skips every check and exits 0
 *   CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID  defaults to the account named in DEPLOY.md
 *   CANARY_RECEIPT_PATH    defaults to ../../deploy-receipts/latest.json
