## Not testable with the stub provider

None.

## Not testable yet

- **D-4** — At $0, interactive chat keeps working; only non-complimentary work pauses\
  needs SMITHERS_MVP_ZERO_BEARER — a Smithers Cloud bearer whose billing account holds $0

## Passes

- **A-1** — Signed-out shows the chat (transcript + composer): the opening Smithers message carries the sentence, plain-words scopes, and a first-Tab sign-in; no separate landing view (no blank prompt box, no feature list) (1.3s)
- **A-2** — Sign-in to first useful message in <= 90s (1.2s)
- **A-4** — Workspace pre-exists: no clone/install/configure copy anywhere (5.4s)
- **A-6** — No card form anywhere in the product (3.1s)
- **A-7** — <= 3 questions asked in the whole first run (6.9s)
- **B-1** — Close browser mid-turn, reopen: conversation + in-flight work restored and correctly described (2.1s)
- **B-2** — Escape stops foreground work <= 1s with a statement of what stopped (1.3s)
- **B-3** — A server-side kill surfaces in the UI (no silent completion/failure) (2.4s)
- **B-5** — No score/grade/number user-facing (4.4s)
- **B-7** — Zero rating prompts ("was this helpful?" anywhere = fail) (3.3s)
- **C-2** — "/" opens with the recommended command first and bare "/"+Enter runs it (1.3s)
- **C-3** — The whole section-A journey is completable keyboard-only (1.2s)
- **D-3** — No top-up/checkout/card-collection flow is exposed to MVP users (0.4s)
