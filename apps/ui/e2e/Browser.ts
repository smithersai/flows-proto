/*
 * The hermetic e2e harness — the browser half.
 *
 * One system Chrome over the DevTools protocol, the same way the launch
 * checklist's scripts/headless-page.ts and scripts/web-chat-e2e.ts already
 * drive the app. No Playwright and no download, so a CI runner needs nothing
 * beyond the Chrome its image already ships.
 *
 * Discovery, argv and the target URL come from src/launch-checklist/
 * BrowserLaunch.ts, which is unit-tested; only the socket glue lives here.
 *
 * Two rules this file exists to enforce:
 *
 *  - Every wait is bounded. A page that stops answering the DevTools protocol
 *    must fail its suite with the method and target named, never park the run.
 *    A CI job that hangs burns its whole timeout and reports nothing.
 *  - Only a machine with NO browser is a skip. A machine that has Chrome and
 *    cannot drive it throws BrowserLaunchError, which is a failure. Degrading
 *    a crashed browser to a skip deletes the coverage it was meant to prove.
