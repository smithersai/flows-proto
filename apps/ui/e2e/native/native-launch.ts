/*
 * E12.1, E12.2 and CN-22 — the packaged desktop app actually launches, and the
 * page inside it actually boots.
 *
 * There is no headless mode and no CDP endpoint. electrobun.config.ts sets
 * bundleCEF:false on every platform, so the window is the SYSTEM webview —
 * WKWebView here, GTKWebKit on Linux — and neither exposes a DevTools socket.
 * The bun side cannot read the DOM either: BrowserView only offers
 * executeJavascript, which is fire-and-forget with no return value.
 *
 * So the observation channel is the network. The smoke serves the built SPA
 * from a local origin, points the app at it through SMITHERS_APP_URL — the
 * exact mechanism `start:canary` uses — and watches what the window asks for:
 *
 *   GET /                     the webview loaded the document
 *   GET /assets/*.js          the webview parsed it and fetched the bundle
 *   GET /api/auth/session     the bundle EXECUTED: this is main.tsx's boot
 *                             call, reached only after createAppStore resolved
 *                             and the controller was built
 *   no POST /api/client-errors   nothing threw while the page came up
 *
 * That is a real render signal, not a double's say-so: every one of those
 * requests is made by product code running inside the shipped shell.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun e2e/native/native-launch.ts
 *   bun e2e/native/native-launch.ts --target https://canary.smithers.sh   (CN-22)
