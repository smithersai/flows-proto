/*
 * E12.5 and E12.6 — `electrobun build --env=canary` produces a launchable,
 * channel-stamped artifact that actually carries the SPA.
 *
 * The trap this script exists to avoid: what is left at
 * build/canary-macos-<arch>/Smithers-canary.app is the SELF-EXTRACTOR, not the
 * app. The CLI tars the real bundle, deletes it, and puts a self-extracting
 * launcher in its place. So "the .app exists" proves nothing about whether the
 * built SPA shipped. The only way to know is to decompress
 * Contents/Resources/<hash>.tar.zst and list it, which is what this does.
 *
 * E12.7 is NOT covered here and cannot be: there is no signing configuration
 * anywhere in this repository. See the note this script prints.
 *
 * The script does not run `vite build`. dist/ is a shared build output; it
 * asserts dist/index.html is present and lets `electrobun build` copy it, the
 * same as build:canary does after vite.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun e2e/native/native-artifact.ts            verify an existing build
 *   bun e2e/native/native-artifact.ts --build    build canary first, then verify
