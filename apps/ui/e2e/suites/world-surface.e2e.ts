/*
 * E10.2, E10.3, E10.4 — the World pane, driven as a person drives it.
 *
 * The three rows this suite proves are all about what the World surface DOES
 * to the store, not about what a double returned:
 *
 *  - E10.2 an edit typed into the real Milkdown editor reparses the wikilinks
 *    into the note's link graph and stamps `user:world-editor` provenance on
 *    top of the provenance the note already carried.
 *  - E10.3 the trash affordance asks before it acts, the question is
 *    destructive-styled and escapable, and only the confirm deletes.
 *  - E10.4 the empty state left behind by that deletion carries a door out of
 *    itself, and walking through it makes a real note.
 *
 * Nothing here is scripted by a test double. The seed comes from the product's
 * own `initialWorldDocuments`, the edit runs through `AppController`'s
 * `updateDocumentBody`, and every string asserted is a literal that ships in
 * apps/ui/src or in the @smthrs/ui primitive App.tsx renders.
