/*
 * E5 — the flow registry, end to end.
 *
 * Checklist ids proved here: E5.1 (every visible affordance resolves to a named
 * command reachable by /name), E5.2 ("/" opens with the recommended command
 * first and bare "/" + Enter runs it), E5.3 (exact-name precedence, asserted at
 * the keyboard rather than only in a unit fixture), E5.4 (the section-A journey
 * keyboard-only), E5.7 (a registry-driven smoke over every registered command)
 * and E5.8 (/clear keeps before it clears, and keeps everything on a failed
 * sweep).
 *
 * The load-bearing idea is SMOKE_TABLE below. It carries one entry per
 * registered flow, and the first thing this suite does is compare its key set
 * against the live registry for an admin session. A command added to Flows.ts
 * with no entry here fails immediately, and an entry naming a flow that no
 * longer exists fails too — so the smoke's coverage of the registry cannot
 * silently regress by addition, which is the only way coverage ever regresses.
 *
 * Everything is invoked through `controller.commands.run`, which is the one
 * door a button, a slash submit and an agent tool call all share
 * (flows/Commands.ts `runAs`). Smoking that door therefore smokes all three
 * triggers at once.
 *
 * WHAT THE SMOKE PROVES, EXACTLY
 *
 * 83 of the 88 registered flows are invoked; the other 5 are destructive and
 * are proved registered and proved never invoked instead. Every invocation is
 * held to two bars:
 *
 *  1. `honest` — the refusal shape. Never unknown-command; a failure carries a
 *     non-empty message with no interpolated `undefined`, no stringified
 *     object, no stack frame and no FlowBinding cell frame.
 *  2. `floor` — the effect. Every entry declares the effect class its
 *     invocation must produce (an answer, a message, a card, a toast, some
 *     other journaled state change, or an honest refusal), and at least one of
 *     them must actually be observed. 15 entries additionally pin the WORDING
 *     of the refusal they answer with, so "it failed with some string" is not
 *     the bar for them. A flow that returns `executed` while journaling nothing
 *     and answering nothing fails.
 *
 * What that still does NOT prove:
 *
 *  - That the effect is the RIGHT one. `proves` does that, and it is written
 *    for the entries whose effect has a shape worth pinning; the rest satisfy
 *    the floor with a card, a message or a refusal whose CONTENT nothing reads.
 *  - That every seam is wired. Nine of the fifteen pinned refusals are the
 *    product's own words. The other six (`prs.list`, `prs.view`, `prs.review`,
 *    `prs.land`, `billing.upgrade`, `billing.portal`) pin a refusal that is the
 *    DOUBLE saying it has no such route — scripts/stub-backends.ts answers 404
 *    with "platform stub: no route …" / "gateway stub: no route …". Those six
 *    invocations reach the Worker and prove the honest-404 path, nothing more.
 *    The pinned wording is what turns that into a signal: the day the double
 *    grows the route, the pin fails and the entry gets a real bar.
 *  - That six flows do anything at all. `retry`, `chat.stop`, `stop`,
 *    `copy-message`, `connector.downgrade` and `connector.remove` declare
 *    `silent`: in this environment they are no-ops, each entry says which state
 *    makes them one, and the floor pins them to being EXACTLY silent.
