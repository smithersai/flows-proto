/*
 * E3.13 — /api/model/stream is session-gated, streams, and carries a whole
 *         browser chain turn onto the metered upstream.
 * E3.14 — /api/tools/browser-fetch refuses unsafe targets.
 *
 * Both routes already have server unit tests (apps/server/src/ModelStream.test.ts,
 * apps/server/src/index.test.ts "the browser tool route"). Those tests call
 * worker.fetch() in bun with globalThis.fetch patched, so four things stay
 * unproven there and are what this suite adds:
 *
 * 1. The session gate with a REAL identity seam. The unit tests either leave
 *    IDENTITY_UPSTREAM_URL unset or patch fetch to answer 401 unconditionally,
 *    so neither ever mints a session and neither ever proves the signed-in path
 *    through the gate.
 * 2. The gate runs BEFORE the upstream call. The managed-inference double
 *    records every request it receives, so an anonymous refusal that still
 *    forwarded would be visible here as a recorded call. That is the assertion that a re-ordering
 *    of the router turns red — spend, not just status.
 * 3. The upstream's NDJSON crossing a real socket inside workerd. The unit test
 *    answers from a patched fetch in the same process, so it never exercises
 *    workerd's body plumbing, the no-store directive, or byte-for-byte
 *    passthrough over the wire.
 * 4. The client halves: the product's own relay author seat (layerAuthor, the
 *    @smthrs/model machinery over the relay protocol) decodes a stream that
 *    travelled through the deployed Worker, a whole browser chain turn runs on
 *    it, and AppController.openBrowser surfaces the SSRF guard's own sentence
 *    on a browser card instead of a fabricated read.
 *
 * Not covered here, and worth naming: the ABSENCE of buffering on the relay.
 * The upstream double answers with a complete body, so a Worker that read it to
 * the end and re-wrapped it would be indistinguishable from here — content
 * length and all. Proving that needs a double that can pause mid-body.
 *
 * Not covered here, deliberately: the "answers safe ones" half of E3.14. A safe
 * read requires https to a public host with a valid certificate, resolved
 * through the live DNS-over-HTTPS resolver (BrowserFetch.resolveHostOverHttps).
 * No local double can satisfy that without weakening the guard. This suite
 * instead proves the guard is targeted rather than blanket: a public IP literal
 * passes every pre-DNS check and fails at the read, which is the assertion a
 * "refuse everything" regression trips.
