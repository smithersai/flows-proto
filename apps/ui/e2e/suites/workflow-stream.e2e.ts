/*
 * E7.10 / E7.11 / E7.12 — the workflow seam's reconnect, its replay refusal,
 * and the two acts a run card offers.
 *
 * Three lanes, one stack.
 *
 * The seam lane drives `wrangler dev` with raw fetch: the events cursor
 * replays strictly after `afterSeq`, the guards on that cursor answer 400, and
 * `/api/workflow/stream` is proxied as SSE with `Last-Event-ID` forwarded to
 * the relay. The relay double records every resume token it was handed, so a
 * Worker that drops the header is visible rather than assumed.
 *
 * The client lane drives the product's own AppController against a run whose
 * event log this suite writes by hand. It takes the relay tunnel down, appends
 * three events while the connection is dead, brings the tunnel back, and then
 * demands the card's narration equal an exact list. An event lost across the
 * reconnect leaves a hole in that list; an event replayed twice leaves a
 * duplicate. Both are red.
 *
 * The quiet lane reaches the one phase in which the card renders its two
 * buttons and runs both acts through the registry path those buttons dispatch
 * through.
 *
 * Nothing here asserts that a double returned what it was told to return. Every
 * check is on what the Worker forwarded, what the client did with a cursor, or
 * what the card said afterwards.
