/*
 * Billing and grants — checklist E6.3 to E6.6 and E6.8 to E6.10.
 *
 * Every assertion here is aimed at a product seam, never at a double echoing
 * what it was told:
 *
 *  - E6.10 pins the Worker's billing proxy: the trusted-caller path (never the
 *    deployment bearer), client-supplied identity headers stripped, and an
 *    honest 401 that is answered BEFORE anything reaches the billing seam.
 *  - E6.4 pins `zeroBalanceGuard`'s position in the launch sequence: the
 *    refusal must land before `provisionWorkspace`, so neither the client's
 *    call log nor the gateway front may show a single new request.
 *  - E6.3 pins the complimentary rule: the same $0 store still completes a
 *    chat turn and appends no second refusal.
 *  - E6.5 pins exposure: no checkout-shaped command name, both billing
 *    commands unreachable by the model, no card-collection copy in the served
 *    bundle, and the payment routes session-gated and proxied to the platform
 *    rather than to the billing worker.
 *  - E6.6, E6.8 and E6.9 pin the product's admin door: it authenticates with
 *    the admin token, attributes the grant to the VALIDATED admin login rather
 *    than to anything the caller sent, timestamps it, and carries a grantId
 *    the sibling can dedupe on. A double that refuses unattributed grants is
 *    what turns each of those into a real check.
 *
 * One case is not a row and says so where it stands: the untimestamped POST
 * between E6.6 and E6.8 talks only to the billing double, so it is recorded as
 * the precondition E6.8 leans on rather than claiming E6.7.
