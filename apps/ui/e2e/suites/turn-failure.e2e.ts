/*
 * Turn lifecycle — failure, retry, interruption, the stop budget, and restore.
 *
 * Rows E3.9, E3.10, E3.11, E3.5 and E3.6 of apps/E2E-CANARY-CHECKLIST.md.
 *
 * Every assertion here is grounded in a product string or a store field, never
 * in what the chat double was told to say. The double supplies the *shape* of a
 * turn (a partial delta then an error, a stream that never ends); what is
 * asserted is what the product does with it — the reducer the frame lands in,
 * the bubble it keeps, the note it renders, the request it re-POSTs.
 *
 * Two altitudes, deliberately:
 *
 *  - the store altitude runs always, over the real AppStore/AppController/
 *    WebAgent against wrangler dev;
 *  - the page altitude runs when the machine has a Chrome, because the key
 *    binding (E3.5), the reload (E3.6) and the retry button (E3.10) are the
 *    rows themselves and no store call can stand in for them.
 *
 * `browser` stays false on purpose: a machine with no Chrome must still run the
 * store altitude rather than skip all five rows, so the page half is guarded
 * inside `run` instead of by the runner's suite-level skip. That guard skips on
 * exactly one condition — this machine has no Chrome, which is the only thing
 * `browser.openIfAvailable` answers with undefined. A browser that exists and
 * then misbehaves throws, and a throw fails the suite, so a crashed or
 * unreachable Chrome can never delete the page half silently.
 *
 * Every page call this suite makes goes through `bounded()`. waitUntil and
 * waitForText bound how long they poll, not how long one read takes, so a
 * DevTools call that never answers parks the poll forever; this suite's browser
 * half once held the whole runner for 25 minutes that way with no output.
