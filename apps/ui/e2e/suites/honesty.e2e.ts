/*
 * E8.1–E8.6 — honesty, hermetically, against a SCRIPTED model.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
 *
 * The model here is a double. It says exactly what this file told it to say,
 * so nothing below is evidence about the deployed model's character. What the
 * suite proves is what the CLIENT does with a reply:
 *
 *   - an answer that launders an impossible act (§F-1..§F-5) never reaches the
 *     transcript, and the class's own deterministic honest line stands in its
 *     place (Instructions.ts ASK_HONEST_LINES);
 *   - an honest can't-yet is rendered VERBATIM, in the ASCII spelling and in
 *     the typographic-apostrophe spelling the deployed model actually writes;
 *   - an ordinary, possible ask that merely names a class noun streams
 *     untouched, which is the direction that breaks the product if the
 *     detector over-fires;
 *   - after a real run launch, prose claiming run state is replaced by the
 *     client's deterministic line, beside a real run card and exactly one real
 *     run on the relay (E8.6, the wave-12 substitution).
 *
 * It proves NOTHING about whether the real model refuses honestly. That half is
 * not testable hermetically by construction, and it stays a canary probe
 * against the real deployment: launch-checklist rows F-1..F-5 in
 * src/launch-checklist/Rows.ts, run against canary.smithers.sh. If those rows
 * are ever deleted because "the e2e covers honesty", the truth bar is gone and
 * this file will keep passing while the product lies.
 *
 * FAKE_SUCCESS_COPY, the bar those live rows use for the overclaiming
 * direction, is imported rather than restated, so a hermetic pass and a canary
 * row can never drift into disagreeing about what a fake success is. It is
 * applied only to text the CLIENT produced.
 *
 * Two things this suite deliberately does NOT assert, and why.
 *
 * First, HONEST_REFUSAL_COPY grades nothing here. An honest refusal is a thing
 * only a real model can produce; every honest sentence in this file is a
 * fixture this file wrote, so running the bar over one asserts that a constant
 * matches a regex and cannot fail for any product reason. An earlier revision
 * did exactly that and claimed E8 for it. Whether a refusal grades honest
 * stays where it can only be answered: canary rows F-1..F-5.
 *
 * Second, the client's own substituted lines (ASK_HONEST_LINES) are not graded
 * with that bar either, and could not usefully be: four of the five FAIL it
 * today. Measured at this revision only the `messaging` line matches, and the
 * bar is blind to the typographic apostrophe besides. That is a defect in the
 * live grading in src/launch-checklist/Probes.ts, not in the client — when the
 * backstop does exactly its job on a canary run, rows F-1, F-2, F-4 and F-5
 * report honest-refusal=false on the app's own canonical honest answer.
 * Widening that predicate belongs to whoever owns Probes.ts.
