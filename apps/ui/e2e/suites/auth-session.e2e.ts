/*
 * Authentication, sign-out, and session expiry (E1.2, E1.9, E1.10).
 *
 * Three properties the desktop app's whole door rests on:
 *
 *  - E1.9 sign-out returns the real client to the signed-out chat AND kills
 *    the session. Both halves, because either one alone is a live bug: a
 *    store cleared while the cookie still authenticates signs the user back
 *    in on the next reload, and a killed session the client never noticed
 *    leaves the chat pretending to be signed in.
 *  - E1.10 a session that expires mid-session surfaces in the chat off
 *    exactly ONE identity re-probe — never a dead end, never a 401 loop.
 *  - E1.2 the signed-out page IS the chat, and its first Tab stop is the
 *    sign-in affordance.
 *
 * Every path constant comes from smithers-shared/AgentApiRoutes and every
 * page predicate from src/launch-checklist/Probes.ts, so a rename moves the
 * assertion with the product instead of leaving a green string behind.
