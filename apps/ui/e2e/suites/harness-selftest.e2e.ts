/*
 * Harness self-test.
 *
 * Proves the harness end to end before any product suite depends on it: the
 * stack boots, the SPA serves under the isolation headers, a programmable front
 * answers and faults on demand, the identity and chat seams answer through the
 * Worker, the model relay receives the injected key, and the real client wires
 * up against the injected fetch. It asserts the harness, not the product.
