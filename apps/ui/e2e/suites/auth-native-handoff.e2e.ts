/*
 * The native sign-in handoff, end to end (E1.11) and its single-use expiring
 * claim (E1.12).
 *
 * This is the desktop app's ONLY sign-in path: GitHub passkeys cannot complete
 * inside the embedded webview, so OAuth runs in the system browser and the
 * session travels back to the app through a polled claim. Until this suite it
 * had been exercised only against a hand-written fetch mock
 * (src/mainview/state/AuthHandoff.test.ts), which cannot see the product
 * Worker's proxy at all.
 *
 * The epistemic limit, stated plainly: the server half lives in the identity
 * Worker, which is not in this repository. What this suite proves is that the
 * CLIENT and the product Worker honour the contract the double states — the
 * mint reaches the identity seam through the proxy, the binding survives the
 * query string, the ready claim's Set-Cookie survives the proxy and names a
 * real session, the 200 HTML success page is not replaced by the Worker's
 * error surface, and a 404 stops the poll instead of running it out for five
 * minutes. It does NOT prove the deployed identity Worker agrees; that is what
 * the canary drift check is for.
