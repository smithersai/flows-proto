/*
 * E11.1–E11.4 — the Connectors surface, and the platform-proxy seams behind it.
 *
 * Which half of E11.1 is provable here, and which is not:
 *
 *   The local repository picker is an Electrobun native RPC. `pickLocalRepository`
 *   resolves through `rpc.proxy.request` and `rpc` is undefined whenever
 *   `window.__electrobun` is (src/mainview/native/NativeBridge.ts). A browser
 *   harness cannot open the OS directory dialog, so the OS dialog, its
 *   cancellation, and its not-a-repository / permission-denied branches belong
 *   to the native lane. Everything on THIS side of that seam is proved here, at
 *   the seam the native shell implements: the suite injects a scripted
 *   `NativeRepositories` into the real AppController and asserts what the
 *   product does with the picker's answer — the access it asks for, the
 *   capabilities it grants, what a downgrade revokes, and how a refusal
 *   surfaces. The browser half then proves the ABSENCE contract: a web build
 *   renders no local-repository row and reaches `connector.add` from nowhere.
 *
 * Checklist drift, recorded rather than papered over: E11.3 says the connected
 * repo card states "branch / head / worldview facts". The shipped card
 * (ConnectorsSurface.tsx) states name, `${branch ?? "Detached"} · <short head>`
 * and an access badge. There is no worldview fact on it. This suite asserts the
 * three facts that ship and prints one line naming the gap, so a human decides
 * whether to add the fact or amend the row. It does not invent the assertion.
 *
 * The platform-proxy families (/api/notifications/, /api/user/byok-keys,
 * /api/github/import) have unit tests that mock `ctx.http`, so nothing before
 * this suite proved that a browser session is admitted, that the Worker mints
 * the USER's Smithers Cloud token rather than a deployment credential, or that
 * the bearer never comes back to the page. Those three are asserted end to end
 * against the real Worker.
