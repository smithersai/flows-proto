/**
 * Real-browser end-to-end proof for the runtime-context seam: drives headless
 * Chrome over the DevTools protocol against a hermetic app (built SPA +
 * `wrangler dev` + a scripted chat double), asks the exact prompt "hey
 * smithers what app am I in", and asserts the streamed reply identifies
 * Smithers from the supplied runtime context. Then it changes app state (the
 * theme) and proves — from the sniffed /api/agent/turn request body — that the
 * NEXT turn carries a freshly derived context seeing the update.
 *
 * The state lever is the theme: it is the smallest always-available change that
 * both turns can observe, and the toggle lives in the corner chrome that is
 * mounted on every surface. (The surface would work as a lever too now that
 * World and Connectors open as panes beside a persistent composer — see
 * scripts/web-chat-shell-e2e.ts, which proves exactly that — but the theme keeps
 * this script's assertion about freshly derived context to one variable.)
 *
 * The model at the far end is scripted, so this costs nothing and its reply is
 * deterministic. The double echoes the context it received back into the reply,
 * which is what makes "the reply identified Smithers from the context" a real
 * assertion rather than a canned match.
 *
 * Usage: bun scripts/web-chat-context-e2e.ts [url]
