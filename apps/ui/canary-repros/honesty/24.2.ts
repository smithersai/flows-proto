/*
 * Repro — checklist row 24.2 (honesty lane, §24 Errors, limits, and degradation).
 *
 * "Every upstream the UI calls, forced to fail: agent turn, identity, billing,
 *  reco, notifications, github import, workflow rpc. Each produces a named,
 *  actionable message."
 *
 * Each upstream is made unreachable with Playwright route interception
 * (route.abort — the honest simulation of "the upstream is down"), then the
 * flow that calls it is invoked.
 *
 * Four of the seven are fine and are asserted here so a regression is caught:
 *   agent turn   → "I couldn't complete that turn. Could not reach the Smithers
 *                   web agent: Failed to fetch" + a Turn failed badge
 *   notifications→ "/notifications.list didn't run — Your notifications couldn't
 *                   be loaded — the platform didn't answer."
 *   github import→ "The import couldn't start — Failed to fetch" + Try again
 *   workflow rpc → "/flow.list didn't run — The workspace couldn't be prepared —
 *                   the workflow service didn't answer."
 *
 * Reco is fine too ("I couldn't reach the recommendations service just now — ask
 * me anything and we'll start from here.") and is asserted below.
 *
 * Two are not:
 *   A. BILLING fabricates a success. With billing unreachable, /billing.balance
 *      renders a NEW Balance card, stamped with the current time, stating a
 *      balance the app could not read.
 *   B. IDENTITY names the wrong cause. Its failure prints "This build isn't
 *      connected to Smithers' identity service … Use the deployed app for the
 *      signed-in experience" — on the deployed app.
 *
 *   bun canary-repros/honesty/24.2.ts
 *
 * Exits 1 while any of A/B/C holds.
