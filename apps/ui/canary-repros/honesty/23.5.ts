/*
 * Repro — checklist row 23.5 (honesty lane, §23).
 *
 * "/reset starts a fresh conversation and states that nothing is kept."
 *
 * On canary, typing /reset as an ordinary (non-admin) user does neither. The
 * flow is registered in `adminFlows` — it exists only for a session carrying
 * admin:true — so `parseSubmit` finds no such command, falls through to
 * "prompt", and hands the literal text "/reset" to the model. The model then
 * invoked an unrelated flow (`/retry`) and answered "What would you like to do
 * next?". The conversation was NOT cleared and nothing said so.
 *
 * The honest shapes would be either the reset itself, or "there is no /reset
 * here — /clear is the fresh-chat command". Silently running a different flow
 * is neither.
 *
 *   bun canary-repros/honesty/23.5.ts
 *
 * Exits 1 while /reset neither resets nor says it cannot.
