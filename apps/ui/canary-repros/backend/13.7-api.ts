/*
 * Backend-level repro of github/13.7 — "fake success writing to a read-only
 * repository", driven straight at api.jjhub.tech rather than through the SPA.
 *
 * `repo_context` resolves GitHub SOURCE coordinates ("octocat/Hello-World")
 * through the requester's own import provenance into a mirror living in the
 * requester's namespace. Reads may follow that alias. A WRITE resolved the same
 * way lands in the private mirror and answers 201 with a number the mirror
 * invented, so the product tells the user it opened an issue on a repository
 * they cannot write.
 *
 * Exits non-zero while the bug is present (the POST is accepted).
 * Exits 0 once the write is refused by name.
 *
 * Needs CANARY_API_TOKEN — a Smithers Cloud token for an account that has
 * imported octocat/Hello-World:
 *   export CANARY_API_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret -n smithers -o json \
 *     | jq -r '.items[] | select(.data.CANARY_API_TOKEN) | .data.CANARY_API_TOKEN' \
 *     | head -1 | base64 -d)
 *   bun apps/ui/canary-repros/backend/13.7-api.ts
