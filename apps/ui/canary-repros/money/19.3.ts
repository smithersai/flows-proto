/*
 * Checklist 19.3 — "Toasts appear for the events that warrant them, stack
 * without overlapping, and auto-dismiss."
 *
 * Stacking and auto-dismiss are fine. The clause that fails is the first one:
 * a flow the user typed into the composer that FAILS produces no toast at all.
 * `send` (AppController.ts) calls `commands.run(name, args)` without the
 * `.then(surfaceCommandFailure)` that the pointer paths (`runCommand`,
 * `runCommandArgs`) use, so the flow's honest failure string is dropped on the
 * floor. `withToast` compounds it: work that settles inside the 300 ms
 * debounce returns before any toast is dispatched, so a fast failure is silent
 * even on the wrapped flows.
 *
 * Exits non-zero while a failing composer flow raises no toast.
 *
