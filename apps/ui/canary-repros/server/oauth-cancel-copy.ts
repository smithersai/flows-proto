/*
 * Repro — cancelling GitHub's consent screen is reported as a failure of the
 * sign-in service.
 *
 * GitHub sends a refused authorization back as `?error=access_denied` with no
 * `code`. The product Worker forwarded that to the identity worker, which read
 * it as a malformed callback and answered HTTP 400, so the page told the user
 * "the sign-in service answered HTTP 400" — blaming a service for a button the
 * user pressed. The residual copy defect recorded in ../access/2.3.md.
 *
 * The callback is driven directly, so no consent screen has to be revoked and
 * no authorization is touched.
 *
 *   bun oauth-cancel-copy.ts    exit 1 while the bug is present, 0 once it is fixed.
