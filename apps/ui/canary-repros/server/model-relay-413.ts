/*
 * Repro — the model relay answers an over-cap transcript with a raw
 * "Request body is too large.", which names nothing the reader can act on.
 *
 * Every model call replays the whole transcript, so an over-cap body is a fact
 * about the CONVERSATION, not about the message that tripped it. The turn seam
 * (POST /api/agent/turn) already says so; POST /api/model/stream — which
 * carries every turn now that the in-browser chain is the only backend — does
 * not, so the wedge in apps/ui/canary-repros/chat/4.13 still reads as a
 * mechanical refusal with no way out.
 *
 *   bun model-relay-413.ts     exit 1 while the bug is present, 0 once it is fixed.
