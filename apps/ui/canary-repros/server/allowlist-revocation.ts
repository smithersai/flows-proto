/*
 * Repro — removing a login from the closed-alpha allowlist revokes nothing at
 * the seams, and an admin can revoke itself through the only door that could
 * undo it.
 *
 * The server half of checklist row 1.5 (../access/1.5.md). Three defects, one
 * chain:
 *
 *  1. identity derives the session's `admin` claim from its ADMIN_LOGINS var
 *     alone, so a de-allowlisted login comes back
 *     `allowlisted: false, admin: true`;
 *  2. the product Worker's /api/admin/* gate reads only `admin`, so that
 *     session keeps the whole admin surface — the allowlist editor included;
 *  3. the recommendations worker never reads the allowlist at all, so it serves
 *     the full non-degraded digest to an account the alpha just removed.
 *
 * Fixing (1) and (2) makes a self-removal a ONE-WAY door: it revokes the
 * caller's own admin claim, and this route is the only door that could restore
 * it. So the product refuses a self-removal outright, and THAT is what this
 * repro drives — it is the one clause of the chain a single test login can
 * observe live without locking itself out of the alpha.
 *
 * The cross-account clauses (a DIFFERENT login's session going
 * allowlisted:false -> admin:false, its /api/admin/* going 404, its
 * /api/reco/first-run going 403) need a second GitHub account — checklist §0.4
 * names that gap. They are covered by unit tests instead:
 *   apps/server/src/invite-mechanics.test.ts
 *   ~/flows/ui/workers/identity/src/index.test.ts
 *   ~/flows/ui/workers/recommendations/src/index.test.ts
 *
 * This repro NEVER de-allowlists anyone. It leaves the allowlist untouched.
 *
 *   bun allowlist-revocation.ts   exit 1 while the bug is present, 0 once it is fixed.
