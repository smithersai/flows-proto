/*
 * Canary repro A.18 — /flow.create never reaches a terminal state. The
 * transcript shows "Preparing your <owner/repo> workspace…" and then stops:
 * no workflow card, no failure, no toast, and no further /api/ traffic (the
 * workspace is never provisioned — `POST /api/workflow/provision` is never
 * called, though /flow.list on the same repo does call it).
 *
 * Expected: a created workflow that is real on the workspace, or an honest
 *           failure naming what stopped it.
 * Actual:   stuck on "Preparing your … workspace…" for 90s.
 *
