/*
 * Canary repro A.54 — /prs.create is a total no-op. Every form of the
 * invocation (missing `from:`, unknown bookmark, unwatched repo, valid
 * bookmark) renders NOTHING: no pull-request card, no chat message, no toast.
 * The success path was never observed on canary.
 *
 * Expected: `/prs.create <title> from:<bookmark> [owner/repo]` opens the pull
 *           request and surfaces the same `pr` card `/prs.view` lands on; a
 *           bad form is refused with the seam's own honest line (e.g.
 *           "prs.create needs a source branch — run /branches.list, then
 *           /prs.create <title> from:<bookmark>").
 * Actual:   zero rendered lines in all four forms.
 *
 * Root cause: the refusals `createLandingsSeam.createLanding`
 * (apps/ui/src/mainview/state/seams/LandingsSeam.ts:341) returns are dropped
 * by `send()` in apps/ui/src/mainview/state/AppController.ts:2317, which runs
 * the flow as `void commands.run(name, args)` and discards the outcome.
 *
