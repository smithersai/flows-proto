/*
 * Canary repro A.48 — /issues.create: a failing invocation with arguments is
 * SILENT. The composer accepts it, the seam runs and refuses, and NOTHING
 * reaches the screen: no card, no chat message, no toast.
 *
 * Expected: creating in an unwritable repository is refused, never silently dropped.
 * Actual:   zero new rendered lines.
 *
 * Root cause (shared by every arg-taking flow): `send()` in
 * apps/ui/src/mainview/state/AppController.ts:2317 runs the flow as
 * `void commands.run(parsed.name, parsed.args)` and DISCARDS the
 * CommandOutcome. The button path (`runCommand`/`runCommandArgs`, same file
 * ~4363/4369) attaches `surfaceCommandFailure`, which toasts
 * "/<name> didn't run" plus the seam's honest reason. Typing `/<name> <args>`
 * closes the slash menu (the menu only matches a bare name), so Enter goes
 * through `send()` and the refusal is dropped on the floor.
 *
 *   bun apps/ui/canary-repros/flow-sweep/A.48.ts
