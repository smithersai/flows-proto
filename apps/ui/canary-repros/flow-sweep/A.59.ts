/*
 * Canary repro A.59 — /keys.list cannot succeed on canary. The product
 * Worker proxies GET /api/user/byok-keys to the Smithers Cloud platform
 * (api.jjhub.tech), which answers 404 with the Go router's plain
 * "404 page not found". The UI is honest about it — the toast reads
 * "/keys.list didn't run" over "404 page not found" — but the flow has no
 * working success path, and the toast's detail is a raw upstream body rather
 * than a next step.
 *
 * Expected: the `keys` card, listing provider keys masked (§18.1).
 * Actual:   404 from the platform on every attempt.
 *
