/*
 * Checklist §16.1 — `/flow.create <description>` must produce a workflow, and
 * "the created workflow is real on the workspace".
 *
 * On the canary the launch half works: a real `create-workflow` run starts on
 * the gateway and the card follows it. The result half does not. The run ends
 * in ~1.3 s with two steps (`clarify`, `output`), the card says "Finished."
 * with no result body and no next step, and `/flow.list` afterwards shows the
 * SAME set of workflows as before — nothing was created.
 *
 * This script records the workflow list before and after a `/flow.create`, and
 * exits non-zero when the list did not gain an entry.
 *
 *   cp -R ~/.multi-e2e-profile /tmp/canary-repo-data-profile
 *   bun apps/ui/canary-repros/repo-data/16.1.ts
