/*
 * Repro — checklist row 27.1 ("`bun run build:canary` produces a launchable
 * app") for the Electrobun desktop build.
 *
 * The build SUCCEEDS and the app LAUNCHES, but the app it produces has no
 * backend: `apps/ui/src/bun/index.ts` falls back to `views://mainview/index.html`
 * for any channel other than `dev` unless `SMITHERS_APP_URL` is set, and
 * `build:canary` sets nothing. Every relative `/api/*` fetch in the renderer
 * then resolves against the `views://` scheme and returns empty — the first one
 * the app makes fails on startup:
 *
 *   ERROR ========== empty response for URL: views://mainview/api/auth/session
 *
 * So the shipped canary app opens a window that can never sign in.
 *
 * This repro drives the LOCAL build, not the canary origin — the desktop app is
 * a native WKWebView with no CDP endpoint, so Playwright cannot attach to it.
 * It asserts on the build output and the launcher's own stdout.
 *
 *   bun 27.1.ts
 *   exit 1 while the bug is present, 0 once the built app reaches a backend.
