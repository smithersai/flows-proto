/*
 * Repro — checklist row 27.2 ("First launch: window size, title, and icon are
 * right") for the Electrobun desktop build.
 *
 * The produced app bundle declares `CFBundleIconFile: AppIcon` in Info.plist,
 * but `Contents/Resources/` contains no icon file of any kind — no `.icns`, no
 * `AppIcon` — so macOS falls back to the generic application icon in the Dock,
 * the Finder, and the ⌘-Tab switcher.
 *
 * Window size (1180x800) and title ("Smithers") are declared in
 * `apps/ui/src/bun/index.ts`; they could not be verified visually on this
 * machine (see 27.2.md), so this repro asserts only the icon, which is a
 * checkable property of the built artifact.
 *
 *   bun 27.2.ts
 *   exit 1 while the bug is present, 0 once the bundle ships an icon.
