/*
 * Repro — checklist row 25.7 ("`/admin.health` reports service health, charges,
 * and queue depth, and the numbers are real") against https://canary.smithers.sh.
 *
 * Service health and queue depth ARE real. The charges figure is not: the card
 * reports `Charges: $0.002675 across 393 turns` while billing's own answer for
 * a SINGLE user (`codeplanesmithers`) is chargeCount 1820 and this month's
 * cost $0.34. A fleet total cannot be smaller than one user's, and the health
 * figure does not move as turns are spent (identical at 08:49 and 09:33 across
 * ~170 turns), so it is stale or scoped to something other than what it claims.
 *
 *   PROF=/tmp/canary-admin-profile bun 25.7.ts
 *   exit 1 while the bug is present, 0 once the health charges track billing.
 *
 * Fixture: the session must be admin (identity worker ADMIN_LOGINS).
 * Route: GET /api/admin/health  vs  GET /api/billing/balance, /api/billing/usage
