/*
 * Repro — checklist §12.2: "Import a large repo: progress is legible and the
 * card ends in a terminal state."
 *
 * Expected: the repo-import card reaches DONE or FAILED.
 * Actual: importing facebook/react leaves the card in RUNNING with the note
 * "lost the import stream — run /repos.import again to re-check", and it never
 * leaves RUNNING. Re-running /repos.import re-attaches to the SAME job id and
 * repeats the stall; GET /api/github/import/<jobId> shows the backend job
 * parked at status "cloning" / stage "resolving", updated one second after it
 * was created.
 *
 * Exits non-zero while the bug is present.
 *
 *   cp -R ~/.multi-e2e-profile /tmp/canary-github-profile
