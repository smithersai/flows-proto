/*
 * Repro — checklist §13.5: "/issues.create <title> — the created issue exists
 * on GitHub and the card links to it."
 *
 * Expected: after /issues.create the issue is on github.com/<repo>/issues and
 * the "issue" card carries a link to it.
 * Actual: the issue is created only in the jjhub (api.jjhub.tech) mirror of
 * the repository. Nothing appears on GitHub, and the card carries no anchor at
 * all. Worse, the two number spaces collide: the card shows "Issue #N ·
 * owner/repo" while GitHub's issue #N in the same repository is an unrelated
 * issue, so the card reads as a GitHub issue it is not.
 *
 * Exits non-zero while the bug is present. Set GH_TOKEN (or run with `gh`
 * logged in) so the GitHub half can be checked; without it the script reports
 * the card-link half only and still fails.
 *
