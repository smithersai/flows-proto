/*
 * The boot gate for the persisted store: which backend holds it (E3.6) and
 * which shape version it was written under (E14.2).
 *
 * AppStore calls both halves before it constructs a single collection.
 *
 * The version half. The OPFS/wa-sqlite backend already declares a version:
 * AppStore passes `schemaVersion` plus `schemaMismatchPolicy: "reset"` to
 * `persistedCollectionOptions`, so a shape change drops the database and the
 * app reseeds. The localStorage fallback had no equivalent.
 * `localStorageCollectionOptions` takes no version, and TanStack's
 * `loadFromStorage` only JSON.parses each `{versionKey, data}` envelope — it
 * never runs the collection schema. A row written under an older shape
 * therefore enters the live collection unvalidated, and the first update that
 * validates the full row wedges every later dispatch. `enforceSchemaVersion`
 * gives the fallback the same contract: boot stamps the version, and a boot
 * that reads a DIFFERENT stamp clears every persisted collection key. Reset,
 * not migration, matches the OPFS policy, so both backends behave identically
 * on a bump.
 *
 * A store with NO stamp is adopted rather than cleared. See
 * `enforceSchemaVersion` for why: clearing it wipes the conversation of every
 * user who upgrades into this gate, which is the failure the backend half of
 * this module exists to prevent.
 *
 * The backend half. AppStore can persist into either store, and it cannot
 * merge them. A launch that opens the store the previous launch did not write
 * reads an empty database and greets a returning user with a first-run app
 * while their whole transcript sits in the other one. `recordBackend` stamps
 * the store a launch committed to, and `readRecordedBackend` is what the next
 * launch honours.
 *
 * Both stamps live in localStorage, under the same prefix as the data, and
 * neither is ever cleared as data: they describe where the store is and what
 * shape it has, so losing them with a reset would strand the next launch.

 *   shape this build cannot satisfy, and reset matches the OPFS policy.
 * - No stamp: **adopted**, not cleared. The data stays and the store is

 *
 * Adopting is the difference between an upgrade and a data-loss event. An
 * unstamped store is not an old store; it is a store written before this gate
 * existed, and the gate ships in the same build as the version it stamps, so
 * the rows in it were written by the release immediately before this one. The
 * gate cannot tell that store apart from a genuinely ancient one, and clearing
 * on that ambiguity destroys a real user's conversation to avoid a shape
 * mismatch that is unlikely and recoverable. The failure it trades for is a
 * collection that wedges on the first full-row validation, which `/clear`
 * resolves; the failure it avoids is silent, total, and permanent.
 *
 * This is the same rule the backend stamp follows in `resolvePersistence`:
 * never present an empty store as a returning user's conversation.
