 * could die half-applied. This facade gives the host one atomic commit point:
 * the whole persisted state lives in ONE versioned envelope
 * (`smithers-mvp.store`), and every commit runs a three-step write-ahead
 * protocol — stage, commit, clear — that a boot can always finish or always
 * undo. Collections keep reading and writing their own TanStack keys through
