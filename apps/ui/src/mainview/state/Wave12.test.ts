/*
 * Wave 12 — result claims are deterministic, and the last first-run polish.
 *
 * §1 is the load-bearing one: wave 11 pinned the tool result and the system
 * prompt, and the deployed model still wrote "The workflow
 * "summarize-open-issues" has been created and is now running" beside a card
 * truthfully reading Running. These tests assert the RENDERED turn, not the
 * model's intent — the exact wave-11 transcript is replayed through the real
 * controller and the lie must not be on screen.
 *
 * §2 (which watched repository), §3 (a run the workspace never finishes) and
 * §4 (the residuals) are pinned the same way: through the real controller,
 * against a relay double speaking the shapes the receipts recorded.
